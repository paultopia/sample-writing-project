  {"id":"aakhusCommunicativeWorkOrganizations2017","abstract":"It is argued here that large-scale organization and networked computing enable new divisions of communicative work aimed at shaping the content, direction, and outcomes of societal conversations. The challenge for argumentation theory and practice lies in attending to these new divisions of communicative work in constituting contemporary argumentative realities. Goffman’s conceptualization of participation frameworks and production formats are applied to articulate the communicative work of organizations afforded by networked computing that invents and innovates argument in all of its senses—as product, process, and procedure. Communicative work, however, may be scaffolding argumentative contexts and practices that are quite different than what has constituted past argumentative realities. The computerization of argument happens as organizations invent and innovate argument practice relative to the demands and opportunities of interorganizational communication. The cases and examples examined here suggest that argument practice is evolving around the logic of conversation and the principle of personalization. The analysis challenges argumentation theory to seriously engage with the construction of communicative contexts and the realization of ideas about disagreement management in organizational practice and information infrastructures. Directions for integrating insights from a design perspective on argument with insights from organizational and information systems theory are proposed for coming to terms with an era of large-scale organization and computerization, in particular the evolution of argument practice, the inscription of argument in the built environment, and the absorption of socio-cultural argument practices by organizations and computation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Aakhus","given":"Mark"}],"container-title":"Philosophy & Technology","DOI":"10.1007/s13347-016-0224-4","ISSN":"2210-5433, 2210-5441","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,6]]},"language":"en","page":"191-208","source":"Crossref","title":"The Communicative Work of Organizations in Shaping Argumentative Realities","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13347-016-0224-4","volume":"30"},
  {"id":"abadiaWhigHistoryInterpretation2008","abstract":"During the second half of the twentieth century, historians of science have shown a considerable interest in ‘presentism’, a term ﬁrst applied to the kind of history of science in which past knowledge is judged to celebrate and legitimize modern science. Taking Herbert Butterﬁeld’s The Whig interpretation of history as a point of reference, ‘presentism’ has been usually associated with ‘Whig history’ or ‘Whiggish history’. Nevertheless, Butterﬁeld’s essay is one of many approaches to this question. In this article, I examine Hélène Metzger’s La méthode philosophique dans l’histoire des sciences, a major theoretical contribution of ‘presentism’. I argue that the papers she published in the 1930s are among the most important critical reﬂections on ‘presentism’ written by a historian of science before 1950. Through this examination, I demonstrate that Hélène Metzger‘s ideas can provide historians of science with a useful set of tools to reﬂect upon ‘presentism’, beyond the narrow deﬁnition of the latter as ‘Whig history’.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Abadía","given":"Oscar Moro"}],"container-title":"Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A","DOI":"10.1016/j.shpsa.2008.03.005","ISSN":"00393681","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,6]]},"language":"en","page":"194-201","source":"Crossref","title":"Beyond the Whig history interpretation of history: lessons on ‘presentism’ from Hélène Metzger","title-short":"Beyond the Whig history interpretation of history","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0039368108000216","volume":"39"},

Using data from American National Election Studies surveys, we show that Trump’s unusually explicit appeals to racial and ethnic resentment attracted strong support from white working-class voters while repelling many college-educated whites along with the overwhelming majority of nonwhite voters. However, Trump’s campaign exploited divisions that have been growing within the electorate for decades because of demographic and cultural changes in American society. The 2016 presidential campaign also reinforced another longstanding trend in American electoral politics: the rise of negative partisanship, that is voting based on hostility toward the opposing party and its leaders. We conclude with a discussion of the consequences of deepening partisan and affective polarization for American democracy and the perceptions by both experts and the public of an erosion in its quality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Abramowitz","given":"Alan"},{"family":"McCoy","given":"Jennifer"}],"container-title":"The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science","DOI":"10.1177/0002716218811309","ISSN":"0002-7162, 1552-3349","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,1]]},"language":"en","page":"137-156","source":"Crossref","title":"United States: Racial Resentment, Negative Partisanship, and Polarization in Trump’s America","title-short":"United States","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0002716218811309","volume":"681"},

  {"id":"agarinHowPowersharingIncludes2020","abstract":"As the introduction to the special issue titled Democratisation in Divided Places: Designing Power-Sharing Institutions for Broad Inclusion, this article situates the themes, issues, and findings of the issue in a broad disciplinary perspective. Drawing from theories of constitutional design, peacebuilding, democratisation, and ethnonational accommodation, the article outlines the trade-offs that power-sharing faces in war-topeace transitions and the implications for non-dominant groups. We articulate what we see as a central problem with contemporary power-sharing arrangements, a phenomenon we call the ‘exclusion amid inclusion’ dilemma. That is, for power-sharing to create stability and pacify the dominant groups, it must marginalise non-dominant groups. These are groups who were neglected in the original design of powersharing institutions, who remain on the sidelines of postconflict politics, and who face major institutional constraints on their representation and participation in the power-sharing arrangement. Using ‘exclusion amid inclusion’ as an analytical lens, we explain how the articles included in the special issue highlight how different societies have grappled with the question of facilitating broad inclusion in the design of political power-sharing institutions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Agarin","given":"Timofey"},{"family":"McCulloch","given":"Allison"}],"container-title":"International Political Science Review","DOI":"10.1177/0192512119873075","ISSN":"0192-5121, 1460-373X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,1]]},"language":"en","page":"3-14","source":"Crossref","title":"How power-sharing includes and excludes non-dominant communities: Introduction to the special issue","title-short":"How power-sharing includes and excludes non-dominant communities","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0192512119873075","volume":"41"},

Afghanistan and Pakistan provide valuable comparisons because both states are Muslim-majority countries that are extremely heterogeneous, yet bear the marks of increasingly centralized governments seeking to homogenize national judicial systems amidst rapidly-increasing economic and legal globalization. What is the nature of interaction between Islamic law, local customary/tribal law, and ofﬁcial state-sponsored law in these two countries? Is interaction between these three broad categories of law characteristic of an irreconcilable clash, harmonious fusion, or a series of overlapping jurisdictions? In an age of increasing statutory codiﬁcation is there a dwindling role for local social customs in the production of Islamic law? How do Afghanistan and Pakistan govern conﬂicts between Islamic law and local sociocultural norms in tribally-governed areas, or between these bodies of law and international human rights law? By raising the above issues for discussion it is hoped this study will promote more constructive dialogues between international development organizations and local sociolegal actors in heterogeneous societies like Afghanistan and Pakistan, with potential lessons for additional contexts of legal pluralism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,10,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Ahmed","given":"Faiz"}],"container-title":"Global Jurist","DOI":"10.2202/1934-2640.1222","ISSN":"1934-2640","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,1,6]]},"language":"en","source":"Crossref","title":"Shari'a, Custom, and Statutory Law: Comparing State Approaches to Islamic Jurisprudence, Tribal Autonomy, and Legal Development in Afghanistan and Pakistan","title-short":"Shari'a, Custom, and Statutory Law","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/gj.2007.7.1/gj.2007.7.1.1222/gj.2007.7.1.1222.xml","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"al-aniRebalancingInterestsPower2016","abstract":"Crowdwork on virtual platforms is developing into a recognisable employment and business model on the internet. Despite their many differences, the platforms that have emerged over the last few years have one thing in common: a crowd of individual producers and capabilities is mobilised – in the form of labour, accommodation or durable goods – onto the market in cooperation and competition with firms from traditional industries. This study analyses the factors crowdworkers consider relevant in their work and the measures they view as helpful in improving their working relationship with platforms. It is apparent that, in the best tradition of the peer economy, this new type of worker still considers learning and fun important factors for his or her engagement. Despite these effectively intrinsic factors, workers are quite aware of their situation, which does not put them on equal terms with the platform’s algorithms and customer focus. This awareness of power disparities does not lead them, however, to reconsider their effectiveness when it comes to renegotiating terms with the platform: when specifically asked about the role of unions, the majority of crowdworkers did not expect help in self-organisation from these institutions. Considering the difficulties in regulating the market for platforms, (self-) organisation of crowdworkers, however, is an important prerequisite in rebalancing the power structure dominated by platform owners and their customers. Selforganisation is something digital natives are quite familiar with and we have to assume that crowdworkers are perhaps overconfident in their abilities. And due to the novelty of this industry, this confidence has not been shaken yet by labour disputes or even by growing dissatisfaction with platforms.","author":[{"family":"Al-Ani","given":"Ayad"},{"family":"Stumpp","given":"Stefan"}],"issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","page":"20","source":"Zotero","title":"Rebalancing interests and power structures on crowdworking platforms","type":"article-journal","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"alamBotulinumToxinFacial2008","abstract":"The facial feedback hypothesis suggests that muscular manipulations which result in more positive facial expressions may lead to more positive emotional states in affected individuals. In this essay, we hypothesize that the injection of botulinum toxin for upper face dynamic creases might induce positive emotional states by reducing the ability to frown and create other negative facial expressions. The use of botulinum toxin to pharmacologically alter upper face muscular expressiveness may curtail the appearance of negative emotions, most notably anger, but also fear and sadness. This occurs via the relaxation of the corrugator supercilii and the procerus, which are responsible for brow furrowing, and to a lesser extent, because of the relaxation of the frontalis. Concurrently, botulinum toxin may dampen some positive expressions like the true smile, which requires activity of the orbicularis oculi, a muscle also relaxed after toxin injections. On balance, the evidence suggests that botulinum toxin injections for upper face dynamic creases may reduce negative facial expressions more than they reduce positive facial expressions. Based on the facial feedback hypothesis, this net change in facial expression may potentially have the secondary effect of reducing the internal experience of negative emotions, thus making patients feel less angry, sad, and fearful.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Alam","given":"Murad"},{"family":"Barrett","given":"Karen C."},{"family":"Hodapp","given":"Robert M."},{"family":"Arndt","given":"Kenneth A."}],"container-title":"Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology","container-title-short":"Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jaad.2007.10.649","ISSN":"0190-9622","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,6,1]]},"page":"1061-1072","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Botulinum toxin and the facial feedback hypothesis: Can looking better make you feel happier?","title-short":"Botulinum toxin and the facial feedback hypothesis","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962207022931","volume":"58"},

The study confirms the need for institutions to develop an overarching framework for evaluation in which a valid, reliable, multidimensional and useful student feedback survey constitutes just one part.

While this work updates our view of congressional elections, it is unclear if this holds in the more candidate-centered and high-information electoral context of the U.S. Senate. In this paper, I address these two considerations by evaluating a theory positing that polarization conditions the influence of incumbency and partisanship as Senate election determinants. Using data on the entire direct-election Senate era and survey data, this paper finds that: (1) polarization provides a partisan advantage for candidates running in states in which they are members of the partisan majority and (2) polarization positively conditions the incumbency advantage for Senators representing states that favor the other party.

These platforms empower advertisers to target messages to platform\nusers with great precision, including through inferences about those users'\npolitical affiliations. However, prior work has shown that platforms' ad\ndelivery algorithms can selectively deliver ads within these target audiences\nin ways that can lead to demographic skews along race and gender lines, often\nwithout an advertiser's knowledge.\n  In this study, we investigate the impact of Facebook's ad delivery algorithms\non political ads. We run a series of political ads on Facebook and measure how\nFacebook delivers those ads to different groups, depending on an ad's content\n(e.g., the political viewpoint featured) and targeting criteria. We find that\nFacebook's ad delivery algorithms effectively differentiate the price of\nreaching a user based on their inferred political alignment with the advertised\ncontent, inhibiting political campaigns' ability to reach voters with diverse\npolitical views. This effect is most acute when advertisers use small budgets,\nas Facebook's delivery algorithm tends to preferentially deliver to the users\nwho are, according to Facebook's estimation, most relevant.\n  Our findings point to advertising platforms' potential role in political\npolarization and creating informational filter bubbles. Furthermore, some large\nad platforms have recently changed their policies to restrict the targeting\ntools they offer to political campaigns; our findings show that such reforms\nwill be insufficient if the goal is to ensure that political ads are shown to\nusers of diverse political views.

Although researchers and\njournalists have found many ways that advertisers can target---or\nexclude---particular groups of users seeing their ads, comparatively little\nattention has been paid to the implications of the platform's ad delivery process, comprised of the platform's choices about who should see an ad. It has been hypothesized that this process can \"skew\" ad delivery in ways that the advertisers do not intend, making some users less likely than others to see particular ads based on their demographic characteristics. In this\npaper, we demonstrate that such skewed delivery occurs on Facebook, due to market and financial optimization effects as well as the platform's own predictions about the \"relevance\" of ads to different groups of users. We find that both the advertiser's budget and the content of the ad each significantly contribute to the skew of Facebook's ad delivery. Critically, we observe significant skew in delivery along gender and racial lines for \"real\" ads for employment and housing opportunities despite neutral targeting parameters.\n  Our results demonstrate previously unknown mechanisms that can lead to\npotentially discriminatory ad delivery, even when advertisers set their\ntargeting parameters to be highly inclusive. This underscores the need for policymakers and platforms to carefully consider the role of the ad delivery optimization run by ad platforms themselves---and not just the targeting choices of advertisers---in preventing discrimination in digital advertising.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Ali","given":"Muhammad"},{"family":"Sapiezynski","given":"Piotr"},{"family":"Bogen","given":"Miranda"},{"family":"Korolova","given":"Aleksandra"},{"family":"Mislove","given":"Alan"},{"family":"Rieke","given":"Aaron"}],"container-title":"arXiv.org > cs > arXiv:1904.02095v2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,3]]},"language":"en","title":"Discrimination through optimization: How Facebook's ad delivery can lead to skewed outcomes","title-short":"Discrimination through optimization","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02095v2"},
  {"id":"aligicaPolycentricityPolanyiOstrom2012","abstract":"The article overviews and elaborates the concept of polycentricity, defined as a structural feature of social systems of many decision centers having limited and autonomous prerogatives and operating under an overarching set of rules. The article starts by introducing the concept as it was advanced by Michael Polanyi and developed by Elinor and Vincent Ostrom. It continues introducing possible instances of polycentricity as well as related notions, as part of an attempt to further elaborate the concept through a concept design approach that systematically applies the logic of necessary and sufficient conditions. The article concludes by arguing that the polycentricity conceptual framework is not only a robust analytical structure for the study of complex social phenomena, but is also a challenging method of drawing non-ad hoc analogies between different types of self-organizing complex social systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Aligica","given":"Paul D."},{"family":"Tarko","given":"Vlad"}],"container-title":"Governance","DOI":"10.1111/j.1468-0491.2011.01550.x","ISSN":"1468-0491","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"language":"en","page":"237-262","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Polycentricity: From Polanyi to Ostrom, and Beyond","title-short":"Polycentricity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-0491.2011.01550.x","volume":"25"},

  {"id":"allcottTrendsDiffusionMisinformation2019","abstract":"In recent years, there has been widespread concern that misinformation on social media is damaging societies and democratic institutions. In response, social media platforms have announced actions to limit the spread of false content. We measure trends in the diffusion of content from 569 fake news websites and 9540 fake news stories on Facebook and Twitter between January 2015 and July 2018. User interactions with false content rose steadily on both Facebook and Twitter through the end of 2016. Since then, however, interactions with false content have fallen sharply on Facebook while continuing to rise on Twitter, with the ratio of Facebook engagements to Twitter shares decreasing by 60%. In comparison, interactions with other news, business, or culture sites have followed similar trends on both platforms. Our results suggest that the relative magnitude of the misinformation problem on Facebook has declined since its peak.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Allcott","given":"Hunt"},{"family":"Gentzkow","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Chuan"}],"container-title":"Research & Politics","container-title-short":"Research & Politics","DOI":"10.1177/2053168019848554","ISSN":"2053-1680","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,1]]},"language":"en","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Trends in the diffusion of misinformation on social media","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/2053168019848554","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"allmarkDeathDignity2002","abstract":"The purpose of this article is to develop a conception of death with dignity and to examine whether it is vulnerable to the sort of criticisms that have been made of other conceptions. In this conception “death” is taken to apply to the process of dying; “dignity” is taken to be something that attaches to people because of their personal qualities. In particular, someone lives with dignity if they live well (in accordance with reason, as Aristotle would see it). It follows that health care professionals cannot confer on patients either dignity or death with dignity. They can, however, attempt to ensure that the patient dies without indignity. Indignities are affronts to human dignity, and include such things as serious pain and the exclusion of patients from involvement in decisions about their lives and deaths. This fairly modest conception of death with dignity avoids the traps of being overly subjective or of viewing the sick and helpless as “undignified”.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Allmark","given":"Peter"}],"container-title":"Journal of Medical Ethics","DOI":"10.1136/jme.28.4.255","ISSN":"0306-6800, 1473-4257","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002,8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"255-257","PMID":"12161582","source":"jme.bmj.com","title":"Death with dignity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://jme.bmj.com/content/28/4/255","volume":"28"},

  {"id":"alterInternationalCourtsEnhance","abstract":"One of the main hopes of proponents of international courts is that international courts will in some way encourage greater respect for international law. In truth, we know surprisingly little about the relationship between international courts and compliance with international law. The academic literature yields few direct hypotheses, because it has focused on broader questions of why states follow international law, or contextual factors shaping state compliance with international obligations. Indeed a read of this literature could well lead to the conclusion that courts will contribute very little to enhancing state respect for international law. On the other side of the debate is a literature that asserts that courts will enhance the likelihood that states comply with international law, with little development of when, how, or why courts will enhance compliance with international law.","author":[{"family":"Alter","given":"Karen J"}],"language":"en","page":"29","source":"Zotero","title":"Do International Courts Enhance Compliance with International Law?","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"andersonLearningPatientSafety2015","abstract":"Learning from patient safety incidents is difﬁcult; information is often incomplete, and it is not clear which incidents are preventable or which intervention strategies are optimal. Effective group processes are vital for learning but few studies in healthcare have examined in depth the processes involved and whether they are effective. The aims of this study were to identify factors that facilitated and hindered the process of analysing incidents in teams and to develop and apply a framework of indicators of effective analytic processes. Incident review meetings in acute care and mental health care were observed. Full ﬁeld notes were analysed thematically. A framework of process measures was developed and used to rate each meeting using the ﬁeld notes. Reliability was analysed. Factors hindering analysis were lack of organisational support, high workload and a managerial, autocratic leadership style. Facilitating factors were participatory interactions and strong safety leadership. Process measures showed deﬁcits in critiquing the causes of incidents, seeking further information, critiquing potential solutions and solving problems that crossed organisational boundaries, supporting observational data on the importance of effective leadership. Organisational legitimacy, administrative support, training, tools for incident analysis, effective well trained leaders who empower the team and sufﬁcient resources to manage the high workload were all identiﬁed in this study as necessary changes to improve learning. Future studies could develop and validate the proposed framework of process indicators to provide a tool for teams to use as an aid to improve the analysis of incidents.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Anderson","given":"Janet E."},{"family":"Kodate","given":"Naonori"}],"container-title":"Safety Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.ssci.2015.07.012","ISSN":"09257535","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,12]]},"language":"en","page":"105-114","source":"Crossref","title":"Learning from patient safety incidents in incident review meetings: Organisational factors and indicators of analytic process effectiveness","title-short":"Learning from patient safety incidents in incident review meetings","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0925753515001769","volume":"80"},

  {"id":"andersonSENETHICSDEMOCRACY2003","abstract":"Amartya Sen’s ethical theorizing helps feminists resolve the tensions between the claims of women’s particular perspectives and moral objectivity. His concept of ‘‘positional objectivity’’ highlights the epistemological signiﬁcance of value judgments made from particular social positions, while holding that certain values may become widely shared. He shows how acknowledging positionality is consistent with afﬁrming the universal value of democracy. This article builds on Sen’s work by proposing an analysis of democracy as a set of institutions that aims to intelligently utilize positional information for shared ends. This epistemological analysis of democracy offers a way to understand the rationale for reserving political ofﬁces for women. From a political point of view, gendered positions are better thought of as an epistemological resource than as a ground of identity politics – that is, of parochial identiﬁcation and solidarity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Anderson","given":"Elizabeth"}],"container-title":"Feminist Economics","DOI":"10.1080/1354570022000077953","ISSN":"1354-5701, 1466-4372","issue":"2-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,1]]},"language":"en","page":"239-261","source":"Crossref","title":"SEN, ETHICS, AND DEMOCRACY","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1354570022000077953","volume":"9"},

Governance platforms are now being constructed by a wide array of actors at different geographical scales and across a wide range of issue areas. Although often enabled by digital technology, governance platforms fundamentally embody a new organizing logic to achieve distributed participation and mobilization. While private platforms are transforming the way that companies create and market their products or services and shifting the fundamental logic of how value is produced and appropriated, can this powerful organizing logic be harnessed for public as well as private purposes? We investigate how governance platforms generate powerful effects and survey the extant literature on governance platforms. We conclude that governance platforms do demonstrate promise, although they face a number of challenges.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Ansell","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Miura","given":"Satoshi"}],"container-title":"Public Administration","DOI":"10.1111/padm.12636","ISSN":"1467-9299","issue":"n/a","language":"en","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Can the power of platforms be harnessed for governance?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/padm.12636","volume":"n/a"},

  {"id":"anttiroikoCityasaPlatformRiseParticipatory2016","abstract":"This paper discusses the forms and social implications of citizen engagement in government-sponsored participatory innovation platforms designed to serve urban economic renewal. Discussion starts with a review of smart city discourse, which in the context of economic development policy translates into cities’ need to support innovativeness by creating smart environments, including facilitated participatory innovation platforms. Platform thinking is gaining prominence in economic renewal as it enables the utilisation of collective intelligence that emanates from the diversity of citizens and other stakeholders involved in local innovation processes. Real-life examples of urban platformisation discussed in this paper include enabler-driven innovation platforms and living labs in two Finnish cities, those of Helsinki and Tampere. Discussion centres on three cases, which involve different target groups in participatory innovation processes: Helsinki Living Labs (users), Demola (students) and Koklaamo (residents). Platforms are used to support both urban revitalisation and economic development, of which the former is based primarily on representative and the latter on instrumental mode of participation. If participatory platforms become a norm in local governance, it will mark a transition from party politics, expert dominance and siloed bureaucracy to public engagement which supports citizens’ efforts to produce local public services and to build their own city. In the Nordic welfare society context democratic culture, welfarism and redistributive policy provide support to the emergence of participatory innovation platforms by strengthening social inclusion, taming the growth machine, and easing the tensions between pro-growth and anti-growth coalitions. To summarise, the challenge to cities in different societal contexts is to find locally adjusted ways to facilitate platformisation, and through platform-based citizen engagement support inclusive local economic development, which can be seen as a ‘soft strategy’ for easing social polarisation, socio-economic segregation and intra-national inequalities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Anttiroiko","given":"Ari-Veikko"}],"container-title":"Sustainability","DOI":"10.3390/su8090922","ISSN":"2071-1050","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,10]]},"language":"en","page":"922","source":"Crossref","title":"City-as-a-Platform: The Rise of Participatory Innovation Platforms in Finnish Cities","title-short":"City-as-a-Platform","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/8/9/922","volume":"8"},

Many studies have proposed approaches to measure online deliberation and to evaluate which are the best design principles for deliberative online platforms. However, little research has focused on how deliberation in online platforms is affected by the arrival of events like the emergence of new topics or the modification of platform features. In this article we present a methodology to detect events that affect online deliberation in online discussions. Our results on Menéame, the most popular Spanish social news site, show that a change in how discussions are shown to the user, from a linear to a hierarchical conversation view, significantly enhanced deliberation.

The fractured state of research and evidence on this most important question facing democracy is reflected in the range of disagreement among experts. Facebook chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly called on the U.S. government to regulate election manipulation through social media. But we cannot manage what we do not measure. Without an organized research agenda that informs policy, democracies will remain vulnerable to foreign and domestic attacks. Thankfully, social media's effects are, in our view, eminently measurable. Here, we advocate a research agenda for measuring social media manipulation of elections, highlight underutilized approaches to rigorous causal inference, and discuss political, legal, and ethical implications of undertaking such analysis. Consideration of this research agenda illuminates the need to overcome important trade-offs for public and corporate policy—for example, between election integrity and privacy. We have promising research tools, but they have not been applied to election manipulation, mainly because of a lack of access to data and lack of cooperation from the platforms (driven in part by public policy and political constraints).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Aral","given":"Sinan"},{"family":"Eckles","given":"Dean"}],"container-title":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.aaw8243","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"6456","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,30]]},"language":"en","page":"858-861","PMID":"31467206","source":"science.sciencemag.org","title":"Protecting elections from social media manipulation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6456/858","volume":"365"},

The ‘new constitutionalism’ is considered the novel feature of the post-1989 transition to democracy, and is analytically contrasted with the old constitutionalism and the classic idea of rule of law, and with the ideological constitution-making of the intervening era. The role of constitutional courts as the typical institution of the new constitutionalism is highlighted. The concept of ‘constitutional politics’ is developed to throw light on the process of political reconstruction, and the variation in its interface with the law is considered along a spectrum ranging from the ‘judicialization of politics’ to the ‘politicization of the judiciary’. Contemporary constitutional regimes are compared with respect to their distance from ideological politico-legal regimes, the extent to which the emergency powers of the head of the state creates a situation of ‘dual legality’, and in terms of the contribution of their major institutions to the transition to democracy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Arjomand","given":"Saïd Amir"}],"container-title":"International Sociology","DOI":"10.1177/0268580903018001002","ISSN":"0268-5809, 1461-7242","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,3]]},"language":"en","page":"7-32","source":"Crossref","title":"Law, Political Reconstruction and Constitutional Politics","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0268580903018001002","volume":"18"},

This same literature defines police legitimacy as something unquestionable and automatic.

We address these limitations in the available scholarship through an analysis of interviews with a diverse sample of Oakland (CA) residents on their experiences with the Oakland Police Department (OPD). Their narratives are presented in the historical context of controversy, budget problems, federal investigations, and racialized violence that help to define the relationship between OPD and Oakland communities. Those interviewed, universally observed OPD’s failure to address the most common crime problems in the city, while others, particularly people of color, found them to be a personal or public threat to safety. Their narratives fly in the face of the manifest functions of municipal police forces, are fully supported by the contemporary empirical history of the OPD, and suggest the illegitimate authority – including the monopoly on the use of force – of organizations like OPD in a democratic society.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Armaline","given":"William T."},{"family":"Sanchez","given":"Claudio G.

Leveraging panel survey data collected shortly before and shortly after Scalia’s passing, as well as an experimental design embedded within a cross-section, I examine how the vacancy differentially impacted attitudes toward the Supreme Court. Unsurprisingly, support begets support, even in a polarized environment. However, exposure to information regarding the legal importance of ﬁlling the vacancy, when coupled with exposure to legitimating judicial symbols, positively inﬂuences diffuse support; Democratic respondents were particularly susceptible to increases in support. Further, perceptions of how political the Court is decreased as a result of positivity inducing experimental manipulations.

  {"id":"arrebolaEconometricAnalysisInfluence2016","abstract":"This article contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the role of the Advocate General in the makeup of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The article measures the influence of the Advocate General on the judgments of the Court of Justice through an econometric study using a probit model with data from annulment procedures of the last twenty years (1994-2014). Despite the acknowledged limitations in establishing the influence of the Advocate General on the case law of the Court of Justice via a quantitative analysis, the regression models used in this article give a statistically significant measure of such influence, improving previous attempts in the literature. The findings suggest that the Court of Justice is approximately 67 per cent more likely to annul an act (or part of it) if the Advocate General advises the Court to annul than if it advises the Court to dismiss the case or declare it inadmissible. These results raise several questions as regards judicial independence and the relevance of the figure of the Advocate General, providing a grounded basis for future discussions and judicial reform.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Arrebola","given":"Carlos"},{"family":"Maurício","given":"Ana Júlia"},{"family":"Portilla","given":"Héctor Jiménez"}],"container-title":"Cambridge International Law Journal","DOI":"10.4337/cilj.2016.01.05","ISSN":"23989173, 23989181","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","page":"82-112","source":"Crossref","title":"An Econometric Analysis of the Influence of the Advocate General on the Court of Justice of the European Union","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.elgaronline.com/view/journals/cilj/5-1/cilj.2016.01.05.xml","volume":"5"},

Over the last five years, an old social cleavage separating pluralists from Islamists has been reactivated.

  {"id":"atuahene2020predatory","abstract":"Between 2011 and 2015, the Wayne County Treasurer completed the property tax foreclosure process for one in four properties in Detroit, Michigan. No other American city has experienced this elevated rate of property tax foreclosures since the Great Depression. Studies reveal that the City of Detroit systematically and illegally inflated the assessed value of most of its residential properties, which led to inflated property tax bills unaffordable to many homeowners. Extraordinary tax foreclosure rates and extensive dispossession resulted. Consequently, Detroit has become a “predatory city”—a new and important sociolegal concept that this Article develops.\n\nPredatory cities are urban areas where public officials systematically take property from residents and transfer it to public coffers, intentionally or unintentionally violating domestic laws or basic human rights. Detroit is not alone. Ferguson, Missouri, New Orleans, Louisiana, and Washington, D.C. are among the other US cities where state actors have used illegal methods to augment public coffers. Although this practice affects many urban areas, US legal scholarship has almost completely overlooked the phenomenon of predatory cities. This Article is the first attempt to understand the intersecting economic, social, and political factors that have caused these struggling cities to become predatory. Through an ethnographic study of illegal property tax assessments in Detroit, I find that predatory systems, rather than a few predatory people, initiated and perpetuated the illicit practices. More specifically, several factors made the City and its residents extremely vulnerable, and thus susceptible, to predation. Against this backdrop of vulnerability, certain legal and governance failures created structural opportunities for predation to advance at scale. Using the Detroit case, this Article identifies, defines, and examines the phenomenon of predatory cities, which scholars and policy makers must begin to better understand and address.","author":[{"family":"Atuahene","given":"Bernadette"}],"container-title":"California Law Review","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"page":"107-182","publisher":"HeinOnline","title":"Predatory cities","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.californialawreview.org/print/predatory-cities/","volume":"108"},

To combat these feelings of unease associated with the sheer volume of news content, some consumers tailor their news ecosystems and purposefully include or exclude content from specific sources or individuals. This study explores customization on social media and news platforms through a survey (N = 317) of adults regarding their digital news habits. Findings suggest that consumers who diversify their online news streams report lower levels of anxiety related to current events and highlight differences in reported anxiety levels and customization practices across the political spectrum. This study provides important insights into how perceived information overload, anxiety around current events, political affiliations and partisanship, and demographic characteristics may contribute to tailoring practices related to news consumption in social media environments. We discuss these findings in terms of their implications for industry, policy, and theory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Auxier","given":"Brooke E."},{"family":"Vitak","given":"Jessica"}],"container-title":"Social Media + Society","container-title-short":"Social Media + Society","DOI":"10.1177/2056305119847506","ISSN":"2056-3051","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"2056305119847506","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Factors Motivating Customization and Echo Chamber Creation Within Digital News Environments","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/2056305119847506","volume":"5"},

It will be argued that important lessons can be learned from the League of Nations’ efforts in the interwar period and the United Nations’ (UN) activities in the immediate post-World War II era, while taking into account the new challenges that arise from modern communication technology. Taking up the League of Nations’ and UN’s distinction between false and distorted news, the international legal framework will be tested, in particular, against the coverage of the 2016 ‘Lisa case’ by Russian government-funded media. This coverage is widely considered to be fake news aimed at destabilizing Germany’s society and institutions. The article argues that false news can be subject to repressive regulation in a sensible manner. Distorted news, however, will have to be tolerated legally since prohibitions in this regard would be too prone to abuse. A free and pluralist media, complemented by an appropriate governmental information policy, remains the best answer to fake news in all of its forms. Due diligence obligations of fact-checking, transparency and remedies that are effective despite difficulties in attribution, and despite a lack of universal acceptance, could likewise be conducive.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Baade","given":"Björnstjern"}],"container-title":"European Journal of International Law","container-title-short":"Eur J Int Law","DOI":"10.1093/ejil/chy071","ISSN":"0938-5428","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,12,31]]},"language":"en","page":"1357-1376","source":"academic.oup.com","title":"Fake News and International Law","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/ejil/article/29/4/1357/5320172","volume":"29"},

  {"id":"baileyHistoricalPresidencyDevelopment2013","abstract":"The scholarly turn to the unilateral presidency has expanded our understanding of the presidency and executive power, but, to date, this body of work has focused on presidents since the New Deal. This is somewhat surprising, given that many of the most well-known unilateral orders were issued before 1900. Rather than being isolated events, they are part of a longer list of unilateral presidential orders among early presidents that, as a group, have received little scholarly attention. This article seeks, first, to introduce “settle down” proclamations (which are issued as warnings to the public) issued by presidents before Theodore Roosevelt as a way to further understand the development of executive power in the early presidency. Second, it uses these proclamations to test whether the findings of the unilateral presidency scholarship hold with respect to unilateral power before the twentieth century. The article concludes by comparing unilateral power to prerogative power and proposing a path for future research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Bailey","given":"Jeremy D."},{"family":"Rottinghaus","given":"Brandon"}],"container-title":"Presidential Studies Quarterly","DOI":"10.1111/psq.12009","ISSN":"1741-5705","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"en","page":"186-204","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The Historical Presidency: The Development of Unilateral Power and the Problem of the Power to Warn: Washington through McKinley","title-short":"The Historical Presidency","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/psq.12009","volume":"43"},

These platforms had different driving actors, somewhat different profiles, and markedly distinct effects. The construction of the first platform was pursued through an e-government project led by a municipal official and financed with funds from the European Union. The second platform was My e-Municipality, an initiative undertaken by a small group of active citizens in collaboration with the city administration. The third platform was a set of interconnected Facebook groups through which citizens protested the destruction of a local park. The article defines and assesses the three distinct models of participation exemplified by the three platforms and discusses the challenges of achieving authentic engagement and response on the part of political and administrative institutions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Bakardjieva","given":"Maria"}],"container-title":"International Journal of Communication","ISSN":"1932-8036","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,30]]},"language":"en","number":"0","page":"19","source":"ijoc.org","title":"Platform Politics in Europe | A Tale of Three Platforms: Collaboration, Contestation, and Degrees of Audibility in a Bulgarian e-Municipality","title-short":"Platform Politics in Europe | A Tale of Three Platforms","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/10809","volume":"13"},

We study the government’s problem when credibility is an issue. We find that several of the standard predictions of the economic model are altered when commitment is taken into account. Specifically, when only fines are used, commitment results in a lower apprehension rate and hence a higher crime rate. However, when jail is used (with or without fines), apprehension rates and jail terms may be higher or lower compared to the optimal static policy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Baker","given":"Matthew J."},{"family":"Miceli","given":"Thomas J."}],"container-title":"European Journal of Law and Economics","container-title-short":"Eur J Law Econ","DOI":"10.1007/s10657-005-1011-3","ISSN":"1572-9990","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"5-15","source":"Springer Link","title":"Credible Criminal Enforcement","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10657-005-1011-3","volume":"20"},

To achieve this, we employ textual analysis and feedback from engagement, meetings and panels with technologists, journalists, editors, non-profits, public relations firms, analytics firms and academics during the globally leading technology conference, South-by-South West, in March 2017. We further argue that what is most significant about the contemporary fake news furore is what it portends: the use of personally and emotionally targeted news produced by algo-journalism and what we term “empathic media”. In assessing solutions to this democratically problematic situation, we recommend that greater attention is paid to the role of digital advertising in causing, and combating, both the contemporary fake news phenomenon, and the near-horizon variant of empathically optimised automated fake news.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Bakir","given":"Vian"},{"family":"McStay","given":"Andrew"}],"container-title":"Digital Journalism","DOI":"10.1080/21670811.2017.1345645","ISSN":"2167-0811","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,2,7]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/21670811.2017.1345645","page":"154-175","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Fake News and The Economy of Emotions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/21670811.2017.1345645","volume":"6"},

Generally, students held stronger beliefs in these myths, in that they believed faculty with excellent publication records were better qualified to evaluate teaching and that student ratings on single general items are accurate measures of teaching effectiveness. On the other hand, faculty believed that student ratings were invalid and unreliable. Further examination of student characteristics revealed that male students held stronger beliefs in these myths. Finally, students' beliefs in these myths were correlated with their actual ratings of nine dimensions of the Student Evaluation of Educational Quality. A discussion as well as suggestions for using student ratings is provided.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Balam","given":"Esenc M."},{"family":"Shannon","given":"David M."}],"container-title":"Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education","DOI":"10.1080/02602930902795901","ISSN":"0260-2938","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,3,1]]},"page":"209-221","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Student ratings of college teaching: a comparison of faculty and their students","title-short":"Student ratings of college teaching","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/02602930902795901","volume":"35"},

This article traces the origin of the debate back to 1967, when renowned labor arbitrators Robert Howlett and Bernard Meltzer took opposing views on the matter in front of the National Academy of Arbitrators. Although Meltzer’s traditional view, that arbitrators should respect the CBA and ignore the law when the two diverge, may have been the more dominant and reasoned one in 1967, recent developments in the field of labor and employment law—namely a tremendous proliferation of employment law statutes, a shift in Supreme Court jurisprudence, and an increasingly skilled pool of arbitrators—have rendered Meltzer’s stance untenable. This article lays out four guideposts for labor arbitrators who are confronted with this challenging issue, ultimately articulating an approach that allows for measured consideration of external law to an extent that was wholly unorthodox in 1967.","author":[{"family":"Baldwin","given":"Philip"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","page":"31","source":"Zotero","title":"The Eternal Debate on External Law in Labor Arbitration: Where We Stand Five Decades After Meltzer v.

  {"id":"banchikDisappearingActsContent2020","abstract":"Human rights groups, journalists, and “open source investigators” increasingly depend on social media platforms to collect eyewitness media documenting possible human rights violations and conflicts. And yet, this content—often graphic, controversial, even uploaded by perpetrators—is often removed by the platforms, for various reasons. This article draws on in-depth interviews to examine how practitioners reliant on human rights–related content understand, experience, and deal with platform content moderation and removals in their day-to-day work.

  {"id":"bandesRemorseCriminalJustice2016","abstract":"A defendant’s failure to show remorse is one of the most powerful factors in criminal sentencing, including capital sentencing. Yet there is currently no evidence that remorse can be accurately evaluated in a courtroom. Conversely there is evidence that race and other impermissible factors create hurdles to evaluating remorse. There is thus an urgent need for studies about whether and how remorse can be accurately evaluated. Moreover, there is little evidence that remorse is correlated with future law-abiding behavior or other legitimate penal purposes, and, in fact, there is evidence that remorse is often conflated with shame, which is correlated with increased future criminality. More accurate information on the nature and evaluation of remorse can be used to reform the criminal justice system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Bandes","given":"Susan A."}],"container-title":"Emotion Review","container-title-short":"Emotion Review","DOI":"10.1177/1754073915601222","ISSN":"1754-0739","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"14-19","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Remorse and Criminal Justice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1754073915601222","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"barberaExplainingSpreadMisinformation2018","abstract":"Over the past few years, concerns about the\nnegative societal consequences of the spread of misinformation have become widespread. While false news and propaganda are far from being a new phenomenon, the emergence and popularization of social networking platforms appear to have increased the prevalence of false news stories and the speed at which they become viral. False rumors and news stories that were spread on social media have been mentioned as one of the reasons for the recent rise of populist candidates in the U.S. and Europe and as fuel inciting violence against ethnic minorities in countries such as Sri Lanka and Myanmar (see e.g. Taub and Fisher, 2018). The same new technology tools that allowed the pro-democracy groups during the Arab Spring to coordinate and start a revolution are now seemingly giving a platform to conspiracy theorists and extremist actors seeking to manipulate the political agenda in their own financial or political interest. However, we still know relatively little about the extent to which false news are indeed widespread on social media and the extent to which they have a causal effect on individual attitude change or offline violence. This short note offers an overview of the existing empirical evidence regarding the prevalence of misinformation on social media sites and different individual- and contextual-level factors that may explain its diffusion.","author":[{"family":"Barbera","given":"Pablo"}],"container-title":"APSA Comparative Politics Newsletter","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","page":"5","source":"Zotero","title":"Explaining the Spread of Misinformation on Social Media: Evidence from the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://pablobarbera.com/static/barbera-CP-note.pdf","volume":"28"},
  {"id":"barberaHowSocialMedia2015","abstract":"A growing proportion of citizens rely on social media to gather political information and\nto engage in political discussions within their personal networks. Existing studies argue\nthat social media create “echo-chambers,” where individuals are primarily exposed to likeminded views. However, this literature has ignored that social media platforms facilitate\nexposure to messages from those with whom individuals have weak ties, which are more\nlikely to provide novel information to which individuals would not be exposed otherwise\nthrough offline interactions. Because weak ties tend to be with people who are more politically heterogeneous than citizens’ immediate personal networks, this exposure reduces\npolitical extremism. To test this hypothesis, I develop a new method to estimate dynamic\nideal points for social media users. I apply this method to measure the ideological positions of millions of individuals in Germany, Spain, and the United States over time, as well\nas the ideological composition of their personal networks. Results from this panel design\nshow that most social media users are embedded in ideologically diverse networks, and\nthat exposure to political diversity has a positive effect on political moderation. This result\nis robust to the inclusion of covariates measuring offline political behavior, obtained by\nmatching Twitter user profiles with publicly available voter files in several U.S. states. I\nalso provide evidence from survey data in these three countries that bolsters these findings. Contrary to conventional wisdom, my analysis provides evidence that social media\nusage reduces mass political polarization.","author":[{"family":"Barberá","given":"Pablo"}],"event":"American Political Science Association","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"source":"Google Scholar","title":"How social media reduces mass political polarization.

  {"id":"barnettHostDilemmaStrategic2011","abstract":"Voluntary forfeiture of intellectual assets – often, exceptionally valuable assets – is surprisingly widespread in information technology markets. A simple economic rationale can account for these practices. By giving away access to core technologies, a platform holder commits against expropriating (and thereby induces) user investments that support platform value. To generate revenues that cover development and maintenance costs, the platform holder must regulate access to other goods and services within the total consumption bundle. The tradeoff between forfeiting access (to induce adoption) and regulating access (to recover costs) anticipates the substantial convergence of open and closed innovation models. Organizational patterns in the software and operating system markets are consistent with this hypothesis: open and closed structures substantially converge across a broad range of historical and contemporary settings and commercial and noncommercial environments. In particular, I show that (i) proprietary firms have formed nonprofit consortia and adopted open licensing strategies in order to develop and promote operating systems for the smartphone market, and (ii) leading “open source” software projects are now primarily funded and substantially governed and staffed by corporate sponsors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Barnett","given":"Jonathan"}],"container-title":"Harvard Law Review","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"language":"en","page":"1861-1938","source":"papers.ssrn.com","title":"The Host's Dilemma: Strategic Forfeiture in Platform Markets for Informational Goods","title-short":"The Host's Dilemma","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://harvardlawreview.org/2011/06/the-hosts-dilemma-strategic-forfeiture-in-platform-markets-for-informational-goods/","volume":"124"},

It argues that social media represent a transnational electronic public sphere, in which public discussions reveal characteristics of international relations as perceived by a foreign public. The findings show that the international relations in social media postings match the core-peripheral structure proposed in the World Systems Theory. Additionally, the relations are associated with the amount of news coverage and public attention a country receives.

  {"id":"barnsPlatformIntermediationRecombinatory2020","abstract":"The chapter addresses more centrally how the creation of platform ecosystems implicates questions of urban governance. While platform services and companies are increasingly recognised as extractive in their programmatic approach to market steering, nevertheless there remain diverse forms of value-sharing and networked sociality active within platform ecosystems. They are not simply sites of sub-ordination. This challenges the way platform influence or control is seen to operate in relation to its users, and in turn the way platform power is conceived. Drawing on insights from social media scholars, the notion of ‘proprietary opacity’ is can be understood as a form of platform governance that is recombinatory in nature—at once activating diverse forms of value-sharing and participation within platform ecosystems, while data harvesting and algorithmic programming remain highly centralised. The recombinatory nature of platform governance provides an important framework through which to understand the nature of contemporary platform influence, beyond the logics of control and subordination. While the increasingly distributed nature of platform technologies represents fresh challenges for urban governance, this chapter also situates contemporary platform architectures as being historically consistent with the development commercial software services. Contemporary platform imaginaries and challenges return us to previous generations of cybernetic thought about control, entropy, information asymmetries and governance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Barns","given":"Sarah"}],"collection-title":"Geographies of Media","container-title":"Platform Urbanism: Negotiating Platform Ecosystems in Connected Cities","DOI":"10.1007/978-981-32-9725-8_7","editor":[{"family":"Barns","given":"Sarah"}],"event-place":"Singapore","ISBN":"978-981-329-725-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","page":"127-156","publisher":"Springer","publisher-place":"Singapore","source":"Springer Link","title":"Platform Intermediation as Recombinatory Urban Governance","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-32-9725-8_7"},

The Article examines the legal nature of human dignity, finding it to be a constitutional principle rather than a freestanding fundamental right, and develops a unifying and universal identity for the concept. At its core, human dignity contains three elements—intrinsic value, autonomy, and community value—and each element has unique legal implications. The Article considers how this elemental approach to the analysis of human dignity can assist in structuring legal reasoning and justifying judicial choices in hard cases, such as abortion, same-sex marriage, and assisted suicide.","author":[{"family":"Barroso","given":"LuÃŁs Roberto"}],"container-title":"Comparative Law Review","language":"en","page":"65","source":"Zotero","title":"Here, There, and Everywhere: Human Dignity in Contemporary Law and in the Transnational Discourse","type":"article-journal","volume":"35"},

We examine how Americans’ preferences regarding this question are influenced by their perceptions of the Court as politicized in how it goes about its work. From a “backlash” perspective, such perceptions should diminish preferences for a political appointment process, while a “political reinforcement” perspective suggests an enhancement effect. National survey data show that large segments of the public perceive of the Court in political terms and prefer that justices be chosen on political and ideological bases. Empirical evidence refutes the backlash hypothesis and supports the political reinforcement hypothesis; the more individuals perceive the Court in politicized terms, the greater their preferences for a political appointment process. Those who view the Court as highly politicized do not differentiate the Court from the explicitly political branches and therefore prefer that justices be chosen on political and ideological grounds.

  {"id":"baserAcademicsPeaceTurkey2017","abstract":"On 11 January 2016, 1128 academics in Turkey and abroad signed a petition calling on Turkish authorities to cease state violence in mainly Kurdish populated areas of the country, which had been under curfew and an extended state of emergency. The petition received an immediate reaction from President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who accused the signatories of treason and terrorist propaganda. He subsequently demanded that public prosecuters launch an investigation. Criminalisation of the petition has been exacerbated by disciplinary action by universities against many of the signatories. Many have suffered insults, arrest, detention or suspension as a result of the ensuing smear campaign. This massive crackdown on academic freedom has been masked by discourses of counterterrorism, which have also been deployed to criminalise dissent more generally in Turkey as a part of a process of rapid “democratic retrenchment” since 2013. This article is an attempt to put the criminalisation of academics within the larger framework of human rights violations, increasing curtailments of academic freedom and rising authoritarianism in Turkey. It argues that the prosecution of the signatories of the petition is an extension of an established tradition of targeting academic freedom in times of political crisis in Turkey but is also a product of growing authoritarianism under the ruling party and President Erdoğan. It shows that counterterrorism laws can be extended far beyond eliminating security threats by instrumentalising them to suppress dissent in a declining democracy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Baser","given":"Bahar"},{"family":"Akgönül","given":"Samim"},{"family":"Öztürk","given":"Ahmet Erdi"}],"container-title":"Critical Studies on Terrorism","DOI":"10.1080/17539153.2017.1326559","ISSN":"1753-9153","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,4]]},"page":"274-296","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"“Academics for Peace” in Turkey: a case of criminalising dissent and critical thought via counterterrorism policy","title-short":"“Academics for Peace” in Turkey","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/17539153.2017.1326559","volume":"10"},

More and morethe enforcement of such rights is being delegated to private Internet operators, and the urgent question is how the task of balancing conflicting rights affects the status of Internet Service Providers (ISPs). The article examines the increasing privatisation of fundamental rights enforcementon the Internet, highlighting the impact of this trend. Following the analysisof recent developments, it argues that the pillars governing ISP liability should not be altered. In particular, the early determination that ISPs should not be presumptively saddled with content monitoring tasks should not be called into question. Therefore, the regulatory pressure on ISPs shouldbe lowered, as the spectre of liability, combined with ISPs' increasing role indeciding the proper balance between conflicting rights, unduly burdens the activity of ISPs and generates incentives to delete even lawful content.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Bassini","given":"Marco"}],"container-title":"European Law Journal","DOI":"10.1111/eulj.12310","ISSN":"1468-0386","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"182-197","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Fundamental rights and private enforcement in the digital age","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/eulj.12310","volume":"25"},

Through this jurisprudence, EEA homogeneity in the ﬁeld of effect and State liability has been maintained. The EEA Main Agreement has been implemented in the domestic legal orders of the EFTA States. EEA secondary law is being implemented in an ongoing process. The same holds true for the rulings of the EFTA Court. There has, to this writer’s knowledge, never been a case in which a national court refused to set aside a conﬂicting rule of domestic law, at least not in a vertical context. That fact is also important from a reciprocity perspective. With respect to the horizontal dialogue with the Community Courts, one must remember that in its Opinion 1/91 on the ﬁrst version of the EEA Agreement the ECJ struck down a provision according to which the Community courts would have been under an obligation to take into account the case law of the EEA courts. In practice, the Community courts have shown openness in cases in which they agree with the outcome as well as with the reasoning of an EFTA Court decision.","author":[{"family":"Baudenbacher","given":"Carl"}],"language":"en","page":"41","source":"Zotero","title":"The EFTA Court: An Actor in the European Judicial Dialogue","type":"article-journal"},

We conducted 44 in-depth interviews with cognitively and behaviorally radicalized Islamist prisoners in Austria as well as former Islamists in Germany and Austria. We found that online propaganda and news media had interdependent influences on Islamists’ rejections of non-Muslims and Western politics, as well as on their willingness to use violence and commit suicide. Cognitively radicalized individuals were influenced by propaganda that blamed non-Muslims for opposing Islam; this was reinforced by online mainstream news reports of right-wing populism and extremism that propagandists selectively distributed via social media. Among behaviorally radicalized individuals, exposure to propaganda and news reports depicting Muslim war victims contributed to the radicalized individuals’ willingness to use violence. Moreover, propaganda and media reports that extensively personalized perpetrators of violence strengthened radicalized individuals’ motivations to imitate the use of violence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Baugut","given":"Philip"},{"family":"Neumann","given":"Katharina"}],"container-title":"New Media & Society","container-title-short":"New Media & Society","DOI":"10.1177/1461444819879423","ISSN":"1461-4448, 1461-7315","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,10]]},"language":"en","page":"146144481987942","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Online news media and propaganda influence on radicalized individuals: Findings from interviews with Islamist prisoners and former Islamists","title-short":"Online news media and propaganda influence on radicalized individuals","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1461444819879423"},

To address this issue and to explore the personal drivers and circumstances of propaganda usage, we conducted in-depth interviews (n = 44) with radicalized Muslim prisoners and former Islamists in Germany and Austria. Our results found that several types of propaganda are used in sequence as individuals undergo cognitive and behavioral radicalization. Propaganda during cognitive radicalization is characterized by religious frames, which strictly advocate Islam as the ‘right’ way, while propaganda used during the behavioral radicalization phase is characterized by suggestions that violence is effective, urgent, and the only way to help Muslims. This use of different kinds of propaganda can be explained by individuals’ needs and the professionalism of Islamist leaders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Baugut","given":"Philip"},{"family":"Neumann","given":"Katharina"}],"container-title":"Information, Communication & Society","DOI":"10.1080/1369118X.2019.1594333","ISSN":"1369-118X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,26]]},"source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Online propaganda use during Islamist radicalization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2019.1594333"},

  {"id":"bayWeaponizingHatersLast2018","abstract":"Political discourse on social media is seen by many as polarized, vitriolic and permeated by falsehoods and misinformation. Political operators have exploited all of these aspects of the discourse for strategic purposes, most famously during the Russian social media influence campaign during the 2016 presidential election in the United States and current, similar efforts targeting the U.S. elections in 2018 and 2020. The results of the social media study presented in this paper presents evidence that political influence through manipulation of social media discussions is no longer exclusive to political debate but can now also be found in pop culture. Specifically, this study examines a collection of tweets relating to a much-publicized fan dispute over the Star Wars franchise film Episode VII: The Last Jedi. This study finds evidence of deliberate, organized political influence measures disguised as fan arguments. The likely objective of these measures is increasing media coverage of the fandom conflict, thereby adding to and further propagating a narrative of widespread discord and dysfunction in American society. Persuading voters of this narrative remains a strategic goal for the U.S. alt-right movement, as well as the Russian Federation. The results of this study show that among those who address The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson directly on Twitter to express their dissatisfaction, more than half are bots, trolls/sock puppets or political activists using the debate to propagate political messages supporting extreme right-wing causes and the discrimination of gender, race or sexuality. A number of these users appear to be Russian trolls. The paper concludes that while it is only a minority of Twitter accounts that tweet negatively about The Last Jedi, organized attempts at politicizing the pop culture discourse on social media for strategic purposes are significant enough that users should be made aware of these measures, so they can act accordingly.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Bay","given":"Morten"}],"container-title":"First Monday","DOI":"10.5210/fm.v23i11.9388","ISSN":"13960466","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,1]]},"language":"en","source":"journals.uic.edu","title":"Weaponizing the haters: The Last Jedi and the strategic politicization of pop culture through social media manipulation","title-short":"Weaponizing the haters","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/9388","volume":"23"},
  {"id":"beamFacebookNewsPolarization2018","abstract":"The rise of social media, and specifically Facebook, as a dominant force in the flow of news in the United States has led to concern that people incur greater isolation from diverse perspectives through filter bubbles (from algorithmic filtering) and echo chambers (from an information environment populated by social recommendations coming from overwhelmingly like-minded others). This evolution in news diffusion comes at a time when Americans report increased affective partisan polarization. In particular, evidence shows increasingly negative attitudes about out-party members. Based on selective exposure and reinforcing spirals model perspectives, we examined the reciprocal relationship between Facebook news use and polarization using national 3-wave panel data collected during the 2016 US Presidential Election. Over the course of the campaign, we found media use and attitudes remained relatively stable. Our results also showed that Facebook news use was related to a modest over-time spiral of depolarization. Furthermore, we found that people who use Facebook for news were more likely to view both pro- and counter-attitudinal news in each wave. Our results indicated that counter-attitudinal news exposure increased over time, which resulted in depolarization. We found no evidence of a parallel model, where pro-attitudinal exposure stemming from Facebook news use resulted in greater affective polarization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Beam","given":"Michael A."},{"family":"Hutchens","given":"Myiah J."},{"family":"Hmielowski","given":"Jay D."}],"container-title":"Information, Communication & Society","DOI":"10.1080/1369118X.2018.1444783","ISSN":"1369-118X","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,3]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2018.1444783","page":"940-958","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Facebook news and (de)polarization: reinforcing spirals in the 2016 US election","title-short":"Facebook news and (de)polarization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2018.1444783","volume":"21"},
  {"id":"beardFleshTheirFlesh2016","abstract":"This article identifies a concept I call ‘boundness’ in James Baldwin’s work and asks how it offers an alternative and embodied way to theorize racial identity, racialized violence and interracial solidarity. In the 1960s, in contrast to black nationalist and integrationist responses to racial domination, Baldwin repeatedly asserts that white and black people are literally bound (by blood) and therefore morally bound together. He posits a kinship narrative that foregrounds racialized/sexual violence, addressing the histories of Southern plantations and Jim Crow communities where lines of racial difference were drawn between siblings or between an enslaved child and his/her biological father. With particular attention to Baldwin’s rhetorical techniques (use of racial signifiers, pronouns, familial language), this article examines boundness in four main texts – White Man’s Guilt, The Fire Next Time, a 1963 Public Broadcasting Service interview and a 1968 speech in London – and demonstrates how the concept functions as a political strategy to provoke shifts in identification.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Beard","given":"Lisa A."}],"container-title":"Contemporary Political Theory; London","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org.proxy.lib.uiowa.edu/10.1057/cpt.2015.72","ISSN":"14708914","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,11]]},"language":"English","page":"378-398","source":"ProQuest","title":"‘Flesh of their flesh, bone of their bone’: James Baldwin’s racial politics of boundness","title-short":"‘Flesh of their flesh, bone of their bone’","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://search.proquest.com/docview/1867926287/abstract/C529ABF15D01471APQ/1","volume":"15"},
  {"id":"beaulacSystematicReviewFood2009","abstract":"INTRODUCTION:\"Food deserts,\" areas characterized by poor access to healthy and affordable food, may contribute to social and spatial disparities in diet and diet-related health outcomes. However, the extent to which food deserts exist is debated. We review the evidence for the existence of food deserts in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas. METHODS:We conducted a systematic review of primary, quantitative, observational studies, published in English or French, that used geographic or market-basket approaches in high-income countries. The literature search included electronic and hand searches and peer-reviewed and grey literature from 1966 through 2007. We also contacted key researchers to identify other studies. We analyzed the findings and quality of the studies qualitatively. RESULTS:Forty-nine studies in 5 countries met inclusion criteria; the amount and consistency of the evidence varied by country. These studies were a mix of geographic and market-basket approaches, but the methodologic quality of studies and completeness of reported findings were mixed. We found clear evidence for disparities in food access in the United States by income and race. Findings from other high-income countries were sparse and equivocal. CONCLUSION:This review suggests that food deserts exist in the United States, where area-level deprivation compounds individual disadvantage. Evidence for the existence of food deserts in other high-income nations is weak.","author":[{"family":"Beaulac","given":"Julie"},{"family":"Kristjansson","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Cummins","given":"Steven"}],"container-title":"Preventing Chronic Disease","container-title-short":"Preventing Chronic Disease","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"page":"A105","title":"A systematic review of food deserts, 1966-2007","title-short":"A systematic review of food deserts, 1966-2007","type":"article-journal","URL":"/pmc/articles/PMC2722409/?report=abstract","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"beckerWisdomPartisanCrowds2019","abstract":"Theories in favor of deliberative democracy are based on the premise that social information processing can improve group beliefs. While research on the “wisdom of crowds” has found that information exchange can increase belief accuracy on noncontroversial factual matters, theories of political polarization imply that groups will become more extreme—and less accurate—when beliefs are motivated by partisan political bias. A primary concern is that partisan biases are associated not only with more extreme beliefs, but also with a diminished response to social information. While bipartisan networks containing both Democrats and Republicans are expected to promote accurate belief formation, politically homogeneous networks are expected to amplify partisan bias and reduce belief accuracy. To test whether the wisdom of crowds is robust to partisan bias, we conducted two web-based experiments in which individuals answered factual questions known to elicit partisan bias before and after observing the estimates of peers in a politically homogeneous social network. In contrast to polarization theories, we found that social information exchange in homogeneous networks not only increased accuracy but also reduced polarization. Our results help generalize collective intelligence research to political domains.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Becker","given":"Joshua"},{"family":"Porter","given":"Ethan"},{"family":"Centola","given":"Damon"}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1817195116","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"22","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,28]]},"language":"en","page":"10717-10722","PMID":"31085635","title":"The wisdom of partisan crowds","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/116/22/10717","volume":"116"},
  {"id":"bednarConstitutionalChangeFederations2013","abstract":"This essay applies new developments in complex systems theory to understand how constitutional change can occur informally, without amendment. The chapter develops a three-part theory of constitutional dynamics by analyzing the the complex interaction of the federal system’s varied building blocks: the national government, the state governments, and the auxiliary institutions of governance (such as a judiciary), and the non-governmental institutions, including the party system. First, constitutional innovation derives from constitutional ambiguity and institutional imperfection. Second, complementary institutions constrain informal constitutional change to an incremental path, preventing radical ruptures from past practice. Third, through a model of behavioral spillovers and cross-domain inﬂuences, the chapter oﬀers a theory of the emergence of constitutional trends. These dynamics may help us to to understand how periods of centralization and decentralization emerge, even as the constitutional text remains constant.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Bednar","given":"Jenna"}],"container-title":"Federal Dynamics","DOI":"10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199652990.003.0013","editor":[{"family":"Benz","given":"Arthur"},{"family":"Broschek","given":"Jörg"}],"ISBN":"978-0-19-965299-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,1,31]]},"language":"en","page":"276-296","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"Crossref","title":"Constitutional change in federations: The role of complementary institutions","title-short":"Constitutional change in federations","type":"chapter","URL":"http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199652990.001.0001/acprof-9780199652990-chapter-13"},
  {"id":"bednarConstitutionalSystemsTheory2012","abstract":"This review considers Adrian Vermeule's The System of the Constitution1 and Richard Epstein's Design for Liberty.2 Vermeule's contribution to the study of constitutions applies some essential tenets of systems thinking that are barely evident in legal analysis and almost nonexistent in political science, and so if the book is widely read in both fields it has the potential to alter the trajectory of constitutional analysis for the better. As (nearly) the opening move, the field remains wide open for future research, and in this essay I offer some suggestions for new avenues. Epstein's concerns for the fate of individual liberty and an expanding bureaucracy are evaluated in terms of Vermeule's approach. Ultimately, what may rescue the United States from the overregulatory fate implied by Epstein's analysis is something not yet developed in Vermeule's thesis: a constitutional culture, emerging within the public and defended by it, which draws the line to preserve liberty and innovation.","author":[{"family":"Bednar","given":"Jenna"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"language":"en","page":"15","source":"Zotero","title":"Constitutional Systems Theory: A Research Agenda Motivated by Vermeule, The System of the Constitution, and Epstein, Design for Liberty","type":"article-journal","volume":"48"},

In this article I suggest a novel beneﬁt of subsidiarity: it boosts the adaptive eﬃciency of federal systems. To remain relevant, federal systems must adapt to meet changing circumstances. The process of adaptation involves both pushing federalism’s boundaries in search of improved national-state balance, and selecting beneﬁcial changes and rejecting harmful ones, a job most eﬃciently conducted by a set of diverse, complementary safeguards. By drawing a distinction between policy subsidiarity and safeguard subsidiarity, I describe how each form of subsidiarity contributes to the process of constitutional adaptation and federal system robustness.","author":[{"family":"Bednar","given":"Jenna"}],"language":"en","page":"26","source":"Zotero","title":"Subsidiarity and Robustness: Building the Adaptive Eﬃciency of Federal Systems","type":"article-journal"},

The article, which introduces a special issue on the same topic, begins by reflecting on how we might approach algorithms from a social scientific perspective. The article is then split into two sections. The first deals with the issues that might be associated with an analysis of the power of the algorithms themselves. This section outlines a series of issues associated with the functionality of the algorithms and how these functions are powerfully deployed within social world. The second section then focuses upon the notion of the algorithm. In this section, the article argues that we need to look beyond the algorithms themselves, as a technical and material presence, to explore how the notion or concept of the algorithm is also an important feature of their potential power. In this section, it is suggested that we look at the way that notions of the algorithm are evoked as a part of broader rationalities and ways of seeing the world. Exploring the notion of the algorithm may enable us to see how algorithms also play a part in social ordering processes, both in terms of how the algorithm is used to promote certain visions of calculative objectivity and also in relation to the wider governmentalities that this concept might be used to open up.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Beer","given":"David"}],"container-title":"Information, Communication & Society","DOI":"10.1080/1369118X.2016.1216147","ISSN":"1369-118X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,1,2]]},"page":"1-13","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The social power of algorithms","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2016.1216147","volume":"20"},

This article analyzes the origins and development of these state felon disenfranchisement provisions. Because these laws tend to dilute the voting strength of racial minorities, we build on theories of group threat to test whether racial threat influenced their passage. Many felon voting bans were passed in the late 1860s and 1870s, when implementation of the Fifteenth Amendment and its extension of voting rights to African‐Americans were ardently contested. We find that large nonwhite prison populations increase the odds of passing restrictive laws, and, further, that prison and state racial composition may be linked to the adoption of reenfranchisement reforms. These findings are important for understanding restrictions on the civil rights of citizens convicted of crime and, more generally, the role of racial conflict in American political development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Behrens","given":"Angela"},{"family":"Uggen","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Manza","given":"Jeff"}],"container-title":"American Journal of Sociology","container-title-short":"American Journal of Sociology","DOI":"10.1086/378647","ISSN":"0002-9602","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,11,1]]},"page":"559-605","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"Ballot Manipulation and the “Menace of Negro Domination”: Racial Threat and Felon Disenfranchisement in the United States, 1850-2002","title-short":"Ballot Manipulation and the “Menace of Negro Domination”","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/378647","volume":"109"},

This book offers responses to the DCPR’s call for multistakeholder dialogue, made ever more pressing by the diverse and raising challenges generated by the platformisation of our economy and, more generally, our society. The analyses featured in this book critically explore the human rights dimension of the digital platform debate, subsequently focusing on the governance of personal data and, lastly, suggesting new solutions for the new roles played by online platforms. This volume includes the Recommendations on Terms of Service and Human Rights, which were elaborated through a multistakeholder participatory process, facilitated by the DCPR. In accordance with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the Recommendations provide guidance for terms of service that may deemed as “responsible” due to their respect of internationally agreed human rights standards.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Belli","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Erdos","given":"David"},{"family":"Fernández Pérez","given":"Maryant"},{"family":"Francisco","given":"Pedro Augusto P."},{"family":"Garstka","given":"Krzysztof"},{"family":"Herzog","given":"Judith"},{"family":"Huszti-Orban","given":"Krisztina"},{"family":"Kaye","given":"David"},{"family":"Laidlaw","given":"Emily B."},{"family":"Lynskey","given":"Orla"},{"family":"Madzou","given":"Lofred"},{"family":"McNamee","given":"Joe"},{"family":"Reda","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Tessier","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Tusikov","given":"Natasha"},{"family":"Zolynski","given":"Célia"},{"family":"Weber","given":"Rolf H."},{"family":"Zingales","given":"Nicolo"}],"ISBN":"978-85-959701-4-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,11]]},"language":"eng","note":"Accepted: 2017-12-18T11:38:28Z","publisher":"FGV Direito Rio","source":"bibliotecadigital.fgv.br","title":"Platform regulations: how platforms are regulated and how they regulate us","title-short":"Platform regulations","type":"book","URL":"http://bibliotecadigital.fgv.br/dspace/handle/10438/19402"},
  {"id":"belliPrivateOrderingRise2016","abstract":"Online communications and activities require the intermediation of numerous private entities that unilaterally define and implement their terms of service (ToS). The substantive provisions set in the ToS regulate the relationships between intermediaries and users with a binding force that may be even stronger than the one exercised by the law. Notably, we stress that internet intermediaries privately enforce their contractual regulation by shaping the architecture of the networks and platforms under their control. Such regulation and implementation do not need to rely on “traditional” public law-enforcement mechanisms and may apply in a transnational fashion. This paper argues that internet governance is witnessing the increasing centralisation of power in the hands of internet intermediaries defining private orderings. While acknowledging that ToS are an efficient and well-suited instrument to regulate the online world, we claim that ToS unilaterally impose rules, despite being presented as voluntarily accepted by the involved parties through the expression of free and informed consent. Based on empirical research, we highlight that ToS and their private implementation affect internet users’ capability to enjoy their human rights, with particular regard to freedom of expression (and innovation), the right to privacy and to due process. Lastly, we put forward some recommendations on internet intermediaries’ compliance with human rights standards.","author":[{"family":"Belli","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Venturini","given":"Jamila"}],"issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","page":"17","source":"Zotero","title":"Private ordering and the rise of terms of service as cyber-regulation","type":"article-journal","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"bellmanBrandSafetyEffects2018","abstract":"Newspapers have reported instances of famous brands' ads running as pre-rolls to terrorist videos on YouTube. Subsequent brand safety fears have led to advertisers pulling their YouTube ads. This study, a lab experiment, tested the effects of program quality and content—particularly violent, sexual or extremist content—on pre-roll ads. The experiment used measures from studies showing significant broadcast TV content effects on mid-roll advertising, using more extreme cable TV content to increase the chances of finding significant effects on pre-roll ads. Overall, the effects were minimal, with no effects on brand attitudes, ad liking, or three ad memory components—encoding, storage, and retrieval. In contrast to research showing program context effects on mid-roll advertising, context effects (e.g., on brand safety) do not seem an issue for pre-roll ads. A brand's reputation might suffer negative effects from pre-roll advertising in other ways, however. A limitation is that this study did not re-test the effects of controversial content on mid-roll advertising.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Bellman","given":"Steven"},{"family":"Abdelmoety","given":"Ziad H.

  {"id":"bellPlatformPressHow2017","abstract":"The influence of social media platforms and technology companies is having a greater effect on American journalism than even the shift from print to digital. There is a rapid takeover of traditional publishers’ roles by companies including Facebook, Snapchat, Google, and Twitter that shows no sign of slowing, and which raises serious questions over how the costs of journalism will be supported. These companies have evolved beyond their role as distribution channels, and now control what audiences see and who gets paid for their attention, and even what format and type of journalism flourishes.\n\nPublishers are continuing to push more of their journalism to third-party platforms despite no guarantee of consistent return on investment. Publishing is no longer the core activity of certain journalism organizations. This trend will continue as news companies give up more of the traditional functions of publishers.\n\nThis report, part of an ongoing study by the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia Journalism School, charts the convergence between journalism and platform companies. In the span of 20 years, journalism has experienced three significant changes in business and distribution models: the switch from analog to digital, the rise of the social web, and now the dominance of mobile. This last phase has seen large technology companies dominate the markets for attention and advertising and has forced news organizations to rethink their processes and structures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Bell","given":"Emily J."},{"family":"Owen","given":"Taylor"}],"DOI":"10.7916/D8R216ZZ","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"publisher":"Columbia University","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"The Platform Press: How Silicon Valley Reengineered Journalism","title-short":"The Platform Press","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/D8R216ZZ"},

Although recent European discussions focus on global constitutionalism, there is increasing reticence on the part of many that prospects of a world constitution are neither desirable nor salutary. This article more closely considers criticisms of these legal transformations by distinguishing the nationalist from democratic sovereigntiste positions, and both, from diagnoses that see the universalization of human rights norms either as the Trojan horse of a global empire or as neocolonialist intentions to assert imperial control over the world. These critics ignore “the jurisgenerativity of law.” Although democratic sovereigntistes are wrong in minimizing how human rights norms improve democratic self-rule; global constitutionalists are also wrong in minimizing the extent to which cosmopolitan norms require local contextualization, interpretation, and vernacularization by self-governing peoples.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Benhabib","given":"Seyla"}],"container-title":"American Political Science Review","DOI":"10.1017/S0003055409990244","ISSN":"1537-5943, 0003-0554","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,11]]},"language":"en","page":"691-704","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Claiming Rights across Borders: International Human Rights and Democratic Sovereignty","title-short":"Claiming Rights across Borders","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/claiming-rights-across-borders-international-human-rights-and-democratic-sovereignty/0DBAC41271F6C1D69D56E347F1F1CADA","volume":"103"},

  {"id":"benhabibDemocraticExclusionsDemocratic2007","abstract":"In my book, The Rights of Others, I developed a discourse-theoretic approach to questions of political membership in liberal democracies, which include practices of citizenship, as well as of immigration, refuge and asylum. This article revisits five issues in response to various criticisms. How can we justify democratic exclusions? Is there a `right to membership' and how can it be reconciled with the different practices of various constitutional democracies? Is there a distinction between normatively acceptable and normatively problematic restrictions on political membership? Does the concept of `democratic iterations' describe normative or empirical processes? How plausible is the binarism of the national and the global? I argue that democratic exclusions can be justified by not discriminating against would-be citizens and immigrants on the basis of ascriptive criteria. Ascriptive characteristics, like one's sex and skin colour, are not the product of one's voluntary doings. Democratic iterations are empirical processes which can be judged in the light of normative criteria deriving from discourse theory. Furthermore, while the binarism of national and global is problematical, alternative configurations of political membership at the present are not more defensible.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Benhabib","given":"Seyla"}],"container-title":"European Journal of Political Theory","container-title-short":"European Journal of Political Theory","DOI":"10.1177/1474885107080650","ISSN":"1474-8851","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"445-462","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Democratic Exclusions and Democratic Iterations: Dilemmas of `Just Membership' and Prospects of Cosmopolitan Federalism","title-short":"Democratic Exclusions and Democratic Iterations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1474885107080650","volume":"6"},

At root, we must continue our work, but be more circumspect about whether what we are finding is the proximate or root cause of the crisis of democratic societies in the early twenty-first century. There is important work to be done, both qualitative and quantitative, that must continue to seek to identify new practices that have the potential to undermine democratic elections and public discourse. Identifying Russian operations, for example, is plainly important, technically difficult, and discloses activities that we are interested in as a public. Nonetheless, evidence of action is not evidence of impact—and in the case of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election, there is little evidence that these efforts actually made a meaningful difference. As we enter a new election cycle—as reports of Iranian interventions join continued concern with Russia—it is critical that we not overstate the success of these campaigns. Nonstop coverage of propaganda efforts and speculation about their impact, without actual evidence to support that impact, feeds the loss of trust in our institutions to a greater extent than the facts warrant. No specific electoral outcome better serves Russia’s standard propaganda agenda—disorientation and loss of trust in institutions generally—than the generalization of disorientation and delegitimation of institutions represented by the present pitch of the debate over election interference.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Benkler","given":"Yochai"}],"DOI":"10.35650/MD.2004.d.2019","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,17]]},"language":"en","publisher":"MediaWell, Social Science Research Council","source":"Crossref","title":"Cautionary Notes on Disinformation and the Origins of Distrust","type":"report","URL":"https://mediawell.ssrc.org/expert-reflections/cautionary-notes-on-disinformation-benkler/"},

  {"id":"bennettDisinformationOrderDisruptive2018","abstract":"Many democratic nations are experiencing increased levels of false information circulating through social media and political websites that mimic journalism formats. In many cases, this disinformation is associated with the efforts of movements and parties on the radical right to mobilize supporters against centre parties and the mainstream press that carries their messages. The spread of disinformation can be traced to growing legitimacy problems in many democracies. Declining citizen confidence in institutions undermines the credibility of official information in the news and opens publics to alternative information sources. Those sources are often associated with both nationalist (primarily radical right) and foreign (commonly Russian) strategies to undermine institutional legitimacy and destabilize centre parties, governments and elections. The Brexit campaign in the United Kingdom and the election of Donald Trump in the United States are among the most prominent examples of disinformation campaigns intended to disrupt normal democratic order, but many other nations display signs of disinformation and democratic disruption. The origins of these problems and their implications for political communication research are explored.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Bennett","given":"W Lance"},{"family":"Livingston","given":"Steven"}],"container-title":"European Journal of Communication","DOI":"10.1177/0267323118760317","ISSN":"0267-3231, 1460-3705","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,4]]},"language":"en","page":"122-139","source":"Crossref","title":"The disinformation order: Disruptive communication and the decline of democratic institutions","title-short":"The disinformation order","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0267323118760317","volume":"33"},
  {"id":"bennettImplicationsNonvotingDemocracy1990","abstract":"This paper reconsiders several of the arguments normative theorists have constructed about political participation's impact on the democratic polity. Two key arguments are addressed in the context of the United States today: (1) does nonvoting pose a threat to democracy; and (2) does nonvoting cause skewed public policies? The CPS's National Election Studies, NORC's 1985 General Social Survey, and Gallup's 1987 \"The People, Press, and Politics\" poll indicate the first can be answered in the negative, but there may be some skews on domestic issues, particularly those dealing with spending for welfare state programs. On the other hand, nonvoters are not more egalitarian or in favor of government ownership or control of industry. Nonetheless, it would be erroneous to discount participation's worth for democratic politics because, if it makes elites pay attention to public opinion, its value is firmly established.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Bennett","given":"Stephen Earl"},{"family":"Resnick","given":"David"}],"container-title":"American Journal of Political Science","DOI":"10.2307/2111398","ISSN":"0092-5853","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[1990]]},"page":"771-802","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Implications of Nonvoting for Democracy in the United States","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2111398","volume":"34"},
  {"id":"bennettLogicConnectiveAction2012","abstract":"From the Arab Spring and los indignados in Spain, to Occupy Wall Street (and beyond), large-scale, sustained protests are using digital media in ways that go beyond sending and receiving messages. Some of these action formations contain relatively small roles for formal brick and mortar organizations. Others involve well-established advocacy organizations, in hybrid relations with other organizations, using technologies that enable personalized public engagement. Both stand in contrast to the more familiar organizationally managed and brokered action conventionally associated with social movement and issue advocacy. This article examines the organizational dynamics that emerge when communication becomes a prominent part of organizational structure. It argues that understanding such variations in large-scale action networks requires distinguishing between at least two logics that may be in play: The familiar logic of collective action associated with high levels of organizational resources and the formation of collective identities, and the less familiar logic of connective action based on personalized content sharing across media networks. In the former, introducing digital media do not change the core dynamics of the action. In the case of the latter, they do. Building on these distinctions, the article presents three ideal types of large-scale action networks that are becoming prominent in the contentious politics of the contemporary era.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Bennett","given":"W.

  {"id":"bensonImmigrationAdjudicationMissing2017","abstract":"The United States spends more than $19 billion each year on border and immigration enforcement.1 The Obama administration removed more people in eight years than the last four administrations combined.2 Yet, to the Trump administration, enforcement is not yet robust enough. Among other measures, the administration favors more expedited and summary removals. More than 80 percent3 of all removal orders are already issued outside the court process: When the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) uses summary removal processes, both access to counsel and an immigration judge can be nearly impossible. Advocates and policy analysts are equally concerned that a backlog of over 545,000 immigration court cases creates delay that harm people seeking asylum and other humanitarian protection. Recent use of priority or “rocket” dockets in immigration court and lack of appointed counsel also interfere with the fair adjudication of claims. Thus the administrative removal system is criticized both for being inefficient and moving too slowly, on the one hand, and for moving too quickly without adequate procedural safeguards, on the other. Both critiques have merit. The challenge is to design, implement, and most critically, maintain an appropriately balanced adjudication system., While it is clear that US removal procedures need reform, process alone will not be able to address some of the systematic flaws within the system. Ultimately, the DHS will need to refine and prioritize the cases that are placed into the system and the government needs new tools, widely used in other adjudication systems, that can reduce backlogs, incentivize cooperation, and facilitate resolution. Congress should similarly reexamine the barriers to status and avenues for regularization or preservation of status. The paucity of equitable forms or relief and the lack of statutes of limitation place stress on the immigration court system. The lack of appointed counsel has a dramatic impact on case outcomes. Without counsel, the rule of law is barely a constraint on government authority. Conversely, a system of appointed counsel could lead to efficiencies and to a culture of negotiation and settlement within the immigration court system., DHS has increasingly used every tool in its arsenal to expeditiously remove people from the United States and most of these tools bypass judicial hearings. In these “ministerial” or expedited forms of removal, there is no courtroom, there is no administrative judge, and there are rarely any opportunities for legal counsel to participate. Moreover, there is rarely an opportunity for federal judicial review. In these settings, the rule of law is entirely within the hands of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers who serve as both prosecutor and judge. There is little record keeping and almost no avenue for administrative or judicial review. This paper will argue that the rule of law is missing in the US removal adjudication system, and will propose ways in which it can be restored.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Benson","given":"Lenni B."}],"container-title":"Journal on Migration and Human Security","container-title-short":"Journal on Migration and Human Security","DOI":"10.1177/233150241700500206","ISSN":"2331-5024","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"331-355","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Immigration Adjudication: The Missing “Rule of Law”","title-short":"Immigration Adjudication","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/233150241700500206","volume":"5"},

This chapter addresses the social data privacy and data integrity vulnerabilities threatening the future of applications based on anticipatory computing paradigms. We investigate the organic reach phenomenon on social networks known to be responsible for propagation of ‘fake’ social content, undermining social media data integrity. We describe experimental work demonstrating that the trustworthiness of a message originator and low levels of the personality trait Agreeableness in the message receiver may increase the organic reach of ‘fake’ content on social networks. These effects may have implications for policy and practise, particularly in relevance to the threat of social data manipulation for anticipatory computing applications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Benson","given":"Vladlena"},{"family":"Buchanan","given":"Tom"}],"container-title":"Cyber Influence and Cognitive Threats","DOI":"10.1016/B978-0-12-819204-7.00008-7","editor":[{"family":"Benson","given":"Vladlena"},{"family":"Mcalaney","given":"John"}],"ISBN":"978-0-12-819204-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"145-158","publisher":"Academic Press","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Social big data and its integrity: The effect of trust and personality traits on organic reach of Facebook content","title-short":"Chapter 8 - Social big data and its integrity","type":"chapter","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128192047000087"},
  {"id":"bentonChallengingMisconceptionsStudent2016","abstract":"Data from student ratings of instruction (SRI) are used ubiquitously as a key element in providing instructors with valuable feedback and evaluators with critical student input. Nonetheless, calls for the elimination of SRI continue to appear in academic journals and higher education periodicals. This paper brings to bear the huge body of research on SRI to which so many academics and institutions have contributed. Some of the most egregiously erroneous statements about SRI are rebutted with brief reviews of the readily available compelling evidence. Although some faculty frustrations about misuse of SRI are valid, we argue that inclusion of student voice is critical. Students can provide useful feedback because they have firsthand experience over multiple occasions of what actually occurred in the classroom. Recommendations are made for best practices in using SRI as one of many sources for improving and evaluating teaching.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Benton","given":"Stephen L."},{"family":"Ryalls","given":"Kenneth R."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,4]]},"language":"en","publisher":"IDEA Center, Inc","source":"ERIC","title":"Challenging Misconceptions about Student Ratings of Instruction.

  {"id":"bentonComparisonCriterionValidity1976","abstract":"Two types of student response inventories for appraising instruction, the Student Instruction Report (SIR) and the Inventory of Student Perceptions of Instruction (ISPI) were administered to 554 students in 30 classes at two Georgia colleges. Mean responses to items were used in principal components analyses with varimax rotation. The two instruments were then administered to 525 students in 31 English classes having a common final examination. Results of multiple regression analyses produced a significant multiple correlation with one instrument and self-reported cumulative grade point averages, with end-of-course grades in English as the criterion variable. Results of this study suggest that student appraisal of college instruction using SIR in conjunction with self-reported  grade point averages are of some help in predicting end-of-course final examination scores. If the effectiveness of an instructor is measured in terms of end-of-course achievement of his class, then college administrators should proceed with caution in using student ratings to gauge instructor effectiveness. Moreover, results of this study lend some support to the use of instruments developed empirically over those developed rationally.

Philosophers such as Condorcet actively promoted the ideal of republicanism in ways that can shed light on current debates. In this paper, I look at one particular source: Le R´epublicain, published in the summer 1791, focusing on previously unattributed articles by Condorcet’s wife and collaborator, Sophie de Grouchy. Grouchy, a philosopher in her own right, is beginning to be known for her Letters on Sympathy, a response to Adam Smith’s Theory of Moral Sentiment, which she published at the same time as her translation of that text into French. I argue, further, that in the texts, which I attribute to Grouchy, we can ﬁnd the early development of a commercial republican theory, a belief, which is reﬂected in her discussion of the ‘cost’ of tyranny.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Berges","given":"S."}],"container-title":"The Monist","DOI":"10.1093/monist/onu011","ISSN":"0026-9662, 2153-3601","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"102-112","source":"Crossref","title":"Sophie de Grouchy on the Cost of Domination in the Letters on Sympathy and Two Anonymous Articles in Le Republicain","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/monist/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/monist/onu011","volume":"98"},

But social media is starting to compete with, or even replace, nationally visible conversations in print and on broadcast media with ad libitum, personalized discourse on virtual social networks3. Instead of broadening their spheres of association, people gravitate towards interactions with ideologically aligned content and similarly minded individuals. Portions of a social network can thus turn into ‘filter bubbles’4, in which individuals see only an algorithmically curated subset of the larger conversation. Filter bubbles reinforce political views, or even make them more extreme, and drive political polarization.

  {"id":"bergstromNewsSocialMedia2018","abstract":"Social network sites are becoming essential to how people experience news. The social media feed is made up of a mixture of private and public postings, and news is intertwined with all sorts of activities. What people are exposed to partly depends on the behaviour of their fellow networkers. Drawing on theories of opinion leaders and the concept of incidental news consumption, this article examines news-gathering on social media using a combination of representative survey data and qualitative interviews with young people aged 16–19. Regression analysis of the survey data reveals the primary factor explaining use of news on social media is the habit of using online news services. Interest in news and age also contribute to this phenomenon. The qualitative study reveals that interviewees’ news consumption through social networks is frequent. While incidental, they nonetheless seem to count on being informed through this medium. There is a widespread presence of opinion leaders in the respondents’ social media feeds, bringing attention to news they otherwise would have missed, and just as important, delivering interpretation and context. The study also indicates that these opinion leaders are perceived as central or even crucial to the news-gathering process.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Bergström","given":"Annika"},{"family":"Belfrage","given":"Maria Jervelycke"}],"container-title":"Digital Journalism","DOI":"10.1080/21670811.2018.1423625","ISSN":"2167-0811","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,28]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/21670811.2018.1423625","page":"583-598","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"News in Social Media","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/21670811.2018.1423625","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"biettiConsentFreePass","abstract":"Across the United States and Europe, notice and consent, the act of clicking that “I have read and agree” to a platform’s terms of service, is the central device for legitimating and enabling platforms’ data processing, acting as a free pass for a variety of intrusive activities which include profiling and behavioral advertising. Notwithstanding literature and findings that lay significant doubts on notice and consent’s adequacy as a regulatory device in the platform ecosystem, courts, regulators and other public authorities across these regions keep adopting and legitimating these practices. Yet while consent seems a good proxy for ensuring justice in the platform economy, it is an empty construct. This paper explains how notice and consent practices in the platform economy are not only normatively futile but also positively harmful. Narrow understandings that focus on voluntariness and disclosure such as the ones generally adopted by regulators and courts fail to account for the systemically unjust background conditions within which voluntary individual acts of consent take place. Through such narrow approaches, regulators are failing to acknowledge that consent cannot be reasonably taken to morally transform the rights, obligations and relationships that it purports to reshape. Further, it positively harms consumers in at least three ways: burdening them with decisions they cannot meaningfully make, subordinating their core inalienable rights to respect and dignity to the economic interests of platforms, and creating widespread ideological resistance against alternatives. Notice and consent as a discourse is hardly contestable and is currently part of the rigid background of assumed facts about our digital environment. As new legislation is devised in the US and new opportunities to reinterpret the GDPR present themselves in the EU, we must be more courageous in looking beyond the façade of individual control and instead grapple with the core structure of corporate surveillance markets. The longer we fail to acknowledge consent’s irrelevance to data governance, the longer we will deny ourselves respect and protection from the ever-growing expansion of digital markets into our lives.","author":[{"family":"Bietti","given":"Elettra"}],"language":"en","page":"60","source":"Zotero","title":"Consent as a Free Pass: Platform Power and the Limits of the Informational Turn","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"binnsTrainerBotInheritance2017","abstract":"The internet has become a central medium through which ‘networked publics’ express their opinions and engage in debate. Offensive comments and personal attacks can inhibit participation in these spaces. Automated content moderation aims to overcome this problem using machine learning classifiers trained on large corpora of texts manually annotated for offence. While such systems could help encourage more civil debate, they must navigate inherently normatively contestable boundaries, and are subject to the idiosyncratic norms of the human raters who provide the training data. An important objective for platforms implementing such measures might be to ensure that they are not unduly biased towards or against particular norms of offence. This paper provides some exploratory methods by which the normative biases of algorithmic content moderation systems can be measured, by way of a case study using an existing dataset of comments labelled for offence. We train classifiers on comments labelled by different demographic subsets (men and women) to understand how differences in conceptions of offence between these groups might affect the performance of the resulting models on various test sets. We conclude by discussing some of the ethical choices facing the implementers of algorithmic moderation systems, given various desired levels of diversity of viewpoints amongst discussion participants.","author":[{"family":"Binns","given":"Reuben"},{"family":"Veale","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Van Kleek","given":"Max"},{"family":"Shadbolt","given":"Nigel"}],"collection-title":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science","container-title":"Social Informatics","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-319-67256-4_32","editor":[{"family":"Ciampaglia","given":"Giovanni Luca"},{"family":"Mashhadi","given":"Afra"},{"family":"Yasseri","given":"Taha"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-319-67256-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","page":"405-415","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Springer Link","title":"Like Trainer, Like Bot?

  {"id":"bipatItNotAll","abstract":"Snapchat is a camera and ephemeral messaging application popular among young adults. Due to its self-destructing content and playful features, Snapchat is often associated with more trivial uses. However, the platform has added functionality to support consumption of news. To understand how users perceive and interact with news content on Snapchat, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 19 users of the platform, focusing on their use of Snapchat during breaking news events, including the 2016/2017 US presidential election and inauguration. Through the lens of Network Gatekeeping, our research explains how users consume breaking news content on Snapchat. We unpack users’ ambiguous perceptions of news reliability on Snapchat, and demonstrate how this contrasts with traditional news consumption. Our research also describes how users’ mental models of how Snapchat works—specifically their theories about how the platform curates news content—shape their judgments of reliability, media bias and authenticity.","author":[{"family":"Bipat","given":"Taryn"},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Kurniawan","given":"Ostin"},{"family":"Jae","given":"Yoon"},{"family":"Starbird","given":"Kate"}],"language":"en","page":"10","source":"Zotero","title":"It is Not All Fun and Games: Breaking News Consumption on Snapchat","type":"article-journal"},

In this article, I show why this approach can yield misleading conclusions about citizen competence. I argue that although citizens with strong partisan loyalties might be forced to accept the same facts, they find alternative ways to rationalize reality. One such way, I show, is through the selective attribution of credit and blame. With four randomized experiments, conducted in diverse national settings and containing closed- as well as open-ended questions, I find that as partisans correctly updated economic beliefs to reflect new facts, they conversely attributed responsibility in a highly selective fashion. Although partisans might acknowledge the same facts, they are apt in seizing on and producing attributional arguments that fit their preferred worldviews.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Bisgaard","given":"Martin"}],"container-title":"American Journal of Political Science","DOI":"10.1111/ajps.12432","ISSN":"1540-5907","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,2]]},"language":"en","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"How Getting the Facts Right Can Fuel Partisan-Motivated Reasoning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajps.12432"},
  {"id":"bjolaCounteringOnlinePropaganda2018","abstract":"Exploring the ‘dark side’ of digital diplomacy, this volume highlights some of the major problems facing democratic institutions in the West and provides concrete examples of best practice in reversing the tide of digital propaganda.\n\nDigital diplomacy is now part of the regular conduct of International Relations, but Information Warfare is characterised by the exploitation or weaponisation of media systems to undermine confidence in institutions: the resilience of open, democratic discourse is tested by techniques such as propaganda, disinformation, fake news, trolling and conspiracy theories. This book introduces a thematic framework by which to better understand the nature and scope of the threats that the weaponization of digital technologies increasingly pose to Western societies. The editors instigate interdisciplinary discussion and collaboration between scholars and practitioners on the purpose, methods and impact of strategic communication in the Digital Age and its diplomatic implications. What opportunities and challenges does strategic communication face in the digital context? What diplomatic implications need to be considered when governments employ strategies for countering disinformation and propaganda? Exploring such issues, the contributors demonstrate that responses to the weaponisation of digital technologies must be tailored to the political context that make it possible for digital propaganda to reach and influence vulnerable publics and audiences.\n\nThis book will be of much interest to students of diplomacy studies, counter-radicalisation, media and communication studies, and International Relations in general.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,2]]},"editor":[{"family":"Bjola","given":"Corneliu"},{"family":"Pamment","given":"James"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Routledge","title":"Countering Online Propaganda and Extremism: The Dark Side of Digital Diplomacy","title-short":"Countering Online Propaganda and Extremism","type":"book","URL":"https://www.routledge.com/Countering-Online-Propaganda-and-Extremism-The-Dark-Side-of-Digital-Diplomacy/Bjola-Pamment/p/book/9781138578623"},

The present study investigated whether this form of feature-based stereotyping might be observed in criminal-sentencing decisions. Analysis of a random sample of inmate records showed that Black and White inmates, given equivalent criminal histories, received roughly equivalent sentences. However, within each race, inmates with more Afrocentric features received harsher sentences than those with less Afrocentric features. These results are consistent with laboratory findings, and they suggest that although racial stereotyping as a function of racial category has been successfully removed from sentencing decisions, racial stereotyping based on the facial features of the offender is a form of bias that is largely overlooked.","author":[{"family":"Blair","given":"Irene V."},{"family":"Judd","given":"Charles M."},{"family":"Chapleau","given":"Kristine M."}],"container-title":"Psychological science","container-title-short":"Psychological \t\t\t\tScience","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004]]},"page":"674-679","title":"The Influence of Afrocentric Facial Features in Criminal Sentencing","title-short":"The Influence of Afrocentric Facial Features in Criminal Sentencing","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/15/10/674.abstract","volume":"15"},

This divergence is largely a function of rulings by the US Supreme Court and the European Court of Human Rights. While the Supreme Court has elected to uphold the freedom to express inflammatory racism in public, the European Court has almost always sided with its 47 member states when they have enforced laws curbing racist hate speech. Although a number of scholars have described the differences between the USA and Europe, there is currently no theoretically informed explanation of this important divergence. In this article, I draw on scholarship about comparative law and freedom of expression to develop and test hypotheses about judicial regulation of racist speech in the USA and Europe. I argue that political cultural variables, legal texts and differences in jurisprudential norms strongly influence the overarching patterns of outcomes we see across jurisdictions. Yet, preferences of individual judges also matter, especially in cases that have shifted the trajectory over time within a region, or that have cut against the grain of the predicted pattern. I examine the course of hate speech regulation in the USA and in Europe, illustrating how the variables identified in the model affected court decisions in each region and reviewing specific cases that constituted turning points in the regulation of racist speech.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Bleich","given":"Erik"}],"container-title":"Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies","DOI":"10.1080/1369183X.2013.851476","ISSN":"1369-183X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,2,1]]},"page":"283-300","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Freedom of Expression versus Racist Hate Speech: Explaining Differences Between High Court Regulations in the USA and Europe","title-short":"Freedom of Expression versus Racist Hate Speech","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369183X.2013.851476","volume":"40"},

The reason for this confusion between the commons and private property in Ostrom's work is that she believes private property is possible only if government protects and enforces it.

  {"id":"bloomDynamicsOpportunityInsurgent2015","abstract":"Political opportunity theory has proven extremely generative, highlighting the importance of macro-structural shifts in making established authorities vulnerable to insurgent challenge. But as critics point out, political opportunity theory flattens both culture and agency, and has fared poorly in explaining the timing of insurgency. Re-theorizing opportunity as leveraged by particular practices, rather than independently conferring to groups, redresses these limits, revealing the proximate causes of mobilization and influence. For a strategic test, this article revisits the forging ground of opportunity theory. Why did President Harry S. Truman, initially an apologist for the slow pace of racial reform in 1945–46, suddenly become an avid advocate of civil rights? Opportunity scholars argue that macro-structural forces caused Truman to advocate civil rights, generating the opportunity for insurgency by blacks as a group. But event structure analysis reveals how Black Anti-colonialist practices leveraged opportunities afforded by the earlier Progressive Challenge to compel Truman to adopt civil rights advocacy. Civil rights advocacy, in turn, allowed Truman to repress Black Anti-colonialist practices, even while setting the stage for the Civil Rights Movement to come. Different forms of insurgent practice leveraged opportunities created by different institutional cleavages; the same opportunities did not advantage all insurgency by a social group.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Bloom","given":"Joshua"}],"container-title":"American Sociological Review","DOI":"10.1177/0003122415574329","ISSN":"0003-1224, 1939-8271","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,4]]},"language":"en","page":"391-415","source":"Crossref","title":"The Dynamics of Opportunity and Insurgent Practice: How Black Anti-colonialists Compelled Truman to Advocate Civil Rights","title-short":"The Dynamics of Opportunity and Insurgent Practice","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0003122415574329","volume":"80"},

  {"id":"boadwayEvasionTimeConsistency1998","abstract":"Evasion and time inconsistency have been prominent concerns in discussions of capital income taxation, both theoretical and applied. This paper establishes a link between them, suggesting a potentially useful role for evasion additional to those previously identified: by committing to relatively lax enforcement, the government may be able to alleviate the welfare loss implied by its inability to commit to the tax rate. The scope for this role proves strikingly wide: it is optimal for the government to facilitate the evasion of the capital income taxes that it chooses to impose whenever the time consistent tax rate exceeds that which would be optimal if the government could commit to it.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,16]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Boadway","given":"Robin"},{"family":"Keen","given":"Michael"}],"container-title":"International Economic Review","DOI":"10.2307/2527302","ISSN":"0020-6598","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1998]]},"page":"461-476","publisher":"[Economics Department of the University of Pennsylvania, Wiley, Institute of Social and Economic Research, Osaka University]","source":"JSTOR","title":"Evasion and Time Consistency in the Taxation of Capital Income","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2527302","volume":"39"},

  {"id":"bodoInterestedDiversity2019","abstract":"Using survey evidence from the Netherlands, we explore the factors that influence news readers’ attitudes toward news personalization. We show that the value of personalization depends on commonly overlooked factors, such as concerns about a shared news sphere, and the depth and diversity of recommendations. However, these expectations are not universal. Younger, less educated users have little exposure to non-personalized news, and they also show little concern about diverse news recommendations. We discuss the policy implications of our findings. We show that quality news organizations that pursue reader loyalty and trust have a strong incentive to implement personalization algorithms that help them achieve these particular goals by taking into account diversity expecting user attitudes and providing high quality recommendations. Diversity-valuing news readers are thus well placed to be served by diversity-enhancing recommender algorithms. However, some users are in danger of being left out of this positive feedback loop. We make specific policy suggestions regarding how to address the issue of diversity-reducing feedback loops, and encourage the development of diversity-enhancing ones.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Bodó","given":"Balázs"},{"family":"Helberger","given":"Natali"},{"family":"Eskens","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Möller","given":"Judith"}],"container-title":"Digital Journalism","DOI":"10.1080/21670811.2018.1521292","ISSN":"2167-0811","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,7]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/21670811.2018.1521292","page":"206-229","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Interested in Diversity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/21670811.2018.1521292","volume":"7"},

Unlike land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship, whose coordination is an outcome of institutional arrangements, the law itself is the institutional embodiment of the voluntary exchange processes evolving from the decisions, but not the design, of judges that form the reliable expectations about who “plans” the coordination of the other four factors of production. The legal theory of Hayek and Leoni lends itself to this dual nature of spontaneous order analysis and also the basis of the burgeoning literature on analytical anarchism. Although Hayek and Leoni were not legal centralists, their conception of law as part of a larger spontaneous order was open-ended to competition and experimentation on the constitutional level of rules just as that experienced on the post-constitutional level of the market itself.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Boettke","given":"Peter J."},{"family":"Candela","given":"Rosolino"}],"container-title":"Atlantic Economic Journal","container-title-short":"Atl Econ J","DOI":"10.1007/s11293-014-9405-7","ISSN":"1573-9678","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"123-131","source":"Springer Link","title":"Hayek, Leoni, and Law as the Fifth Factor of Production","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11293-014-9405-7","volume":"42"},

Using a panel survey design with repeated measures of knowledge acquisition, this study is able to disentangle causality and to demonstrate that more frequent usage of Twitter positively affects the acquisition of current affairs knowledge. The opposite is found for Facebook: More frequent Facebook usage causes a decline in knowledge acquisition. This negative effect of Facebook usage occurred particularly for citizens with less political interest, thereby, amplifying the existing knowledge gap between politically interested and uninterested citizens.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Boukes","given":"Mark"}],"container-title":"Journal of Information Technology & Politics","DOI":"10.1080/19331681.2019.1572568","ISSN":"1933-1681","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,6]]},"source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Social network sites and acquiring current affairs knowledge: The impact of Twitter and Facebook usage on learning about the news","title-short":"Social network sites and acquiring current affairs knowledge","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/19331681.2019.1572568"},
  {"id":"boulianneRevolutionMakingSocial2019","abstract":"Social networking sites are popular tools to engage citizens in political campaigns, social movements, and civic life. However, are the effects of social media on civic and political participation revolutionary? How do these effects differ across political contexts? Using 133 cross-sectional studies with 631 estimated coefficients, I examine the relationship between social media use and engagement in civic and political life. The effects of social media use on participation are larger for political expression and smaller for informational uses, but the magnitude of these effects depends on political context. The effects of informational uses of social media on participation are smaller in countries like the United States, with a free and independent press. If there is a social media revolution, it relates to the expression of political views on social networking sites, where the average effect size is comparable to the effects of education on participation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Boulianne","given":"Shelley"}],"container-title":"Information, Communication & Society","DOI":"10.1080/1369118X.2017.1353641","ISSN":"1369-118X, 1468-4462","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,2]]},"language":"en","page":"39-54","source":"Crossref","title":"Revolution in the making?

  {"id":"boulianneSocialMediaUse2015","abstract":"Social media has skyrocketed to popularity in the past few years. The Arab Spring in 2011 as well as the 2008 and 2012 Obama campaigns have fueled interest in how social media might affect citizens’ participation in civic and political life. In response, researchers have produced 36 studies assessing the relationship between social media use and participation in civic and political life. This manuscript presents the results of a meta-analysis of research on social media use and participation. Overall, the metadata demonstrate a positive relationship between social media use and participation. More than 80% of coefficients are positive. However, questions remain about whether the relationship is causal and transformative. Only half of the coefficients were statistically significant. Studies using panel data are less likely to report positive and statistically significant coefficients between social media use and participation, compared to cross-sectional surveys. The metadata also suggest that social media use has minimal impact on participation in election campaigns.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Boulianne","given":"Shelley"}],"container-title":"Information, Communication & Society","DOI":"10.1080/1369118X.2015.1008542","ISSN":"1369-118X","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,5,4]]},"page":"524-538","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Social media use and participation: a meta-analysis of current research","title-short":"Social media use and participation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2015.1008542","volume":"18"},
  {"id":"boutylineSocialStructurePolitical2017","abstract":"We predict that people with different political orientations will exhibit systematically different levels of political homophily, the tendency to associate with others similar to oneself in political ideology. Research on personality differences across the political spectrum ﬁnds that both more conservative and more politically extreme individuals tend to exhibit greater orientations towards cognitive stability, clarity, and familiarity. We reason that such a “preference for certainty” may make these individuals more inclined to seek out the company of those who reafﬁrm, rather than challenge, their views. Since survey studies of political homophily face well-documented methodological challenges, we instead test this proposition on a large sample of politically engaged users of the social-networking platform Twitter, whose ideologies we infer from the politicians and policy nonproﬁts they follow. As predicted, we ﬁnd that both more extreme and more conservative individuals tend to be more homophilous than more liberal and more moderate ones.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Boutyline","given":"Andrei"},{"family":"Willer","given":"Robb"}],"container-title":"Political Psychology","DOI":"10.1111/pops.12337","ISSN":"0162895X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,6]]},"language":"en","page":"551-569","source":"Crossref","title":"The Social Structure of Political Echo Chambers: Variation in Ideological Homophily in Online Networks: Political Echo Chambers","title-short":"The Social Structure of Political Echo Chambers","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/pops.12337","volume":"38"},

They assert that a great deal of the explanation may be found in the evolutionary accumulation of information, i.e., cultural heritage, that is passed down from generation to generation among people who live the settled lifeway. This cultural heritage evolves into roles and functions of social norms, reciprocity, punishment, intergroup competition, and other types of social institutions. In today’s world, industrial social relations have become the dominant form of cultural heritage.

Research, however, has found that such ratings may not be accurate indicators of teaching performance because they are contaminated by course easiness. Using student ratings of 9855 professors employed at 79 different colleges and universities, the author hypothesized and found that the relationship between perceived course easiness and perceived course quality was moderated by school academic rankings. More specifically, easiness ratings were more strongly correlated with quality ratings among low‐ranked schools than among high‐ranked schools. Furthermore, the easiness–quality relationship was slightly stronger among public schools than among private schools.

Past research has been unable to clarify if intentional revenge for low grades or a more subtle process such as cognitive dissonance leads to low evaluations. This study included a survey of college students (N = 143) that indicated only 8% of students admitted to taking revenge on evaluations and that they rarely cited low grades as a reason for giving low evaluations. However, an experimental manipulation indicated that students may give a low evaluation if they receive a low grade even when they know that most students are doing well in the course.

The AUMF is already the longest operative congressional authorization of military force in U.S. history, and, as of fall 2016, there was no immediate prospect that Congress would move to repeal or update it. With the continued vibrancy of Al Qaeda, its associates, and the Taliban, and with the 2014 presidential extension of the AUMF to cover military operations against the Islamic State, the AUMF is likely to be the primary legal basis for American uses of force for the foreseeable future.","archive":"Cambridge Core","author":[{"family":"Bradley","given":"Curtis A."},{"family":"Goldsmith","given":"Jack L."}],"container-title":"American Journal of International Law","DOI":"10.1017/S0002930000763147","ISSN":"0002-9300","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"page":"628-645","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Obama’s AUMF Legacy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/article/obamas-aumf-legacy/0C250DCD36E1325B7EA136322F3BD2E0","volume":"110"},

Across 3 studies, we investigated whether moral and emotional content captures our attention more than other content and if this may help explain why this content is more likely to go viral online. Using a combination of controlled lab experiments and nearly 50,000 political tweets, we found that moral and emotional content are prioritized in early visual attention more than neutral content, and that such attentional capture is associated with increased retweets during political conversations online. Furthermore, we found that the differences in attentional capture among moral and emotional stimuli could not be fully explained by differences in arousal.

  {"id":"bradyEmotionShapesDiffusion2017","abstract":"Political debate concerning moralized issues is increasingly common in online social networks. However, moral psychology has yet to incorporate the study of social networks to investigate processes by which some moral ideas spread more rapidly or broadly than others. Here, we show that the expression of moral emotion is key for the spread of moral and political ideas in online social networks, a process we call “moral contagion.” Using a large sample of social media communications about three polarizing moral/political issues (n = 563,312), we observed that the presence of moral-emotional words in messages increased their diffusion by a factor of 20% for each additional word. Furthermore, we found that moral contagion was bounded by group membership; moral-emotional language increased diffusion more strongly within liberal and conservative networks, and less between them. Our results highlight the importance of emotion in the social transmission of moral ideas and also demonstrate the utility of social network methods for studying morality. These findings offer insights into how people are exposed to moral and political ideas through social networks, thus expanding models of social influence and group polarization as people become increasingly immersed in social media networks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Brady","given":"William J."},{"family":"Wills","given":"Julian A."},{"family":"Jost","given":"John T."},{"family":"Tucker","given":"Joshua A."},{"family":"Bavel","given":"Jay J.

  {"id":"bradyMADModelMoral2019","abstract":"With over 3 billion users, online social networks represent an important venue for moral and political discourse and have been used to organize political revolutions, influence elections, and raise awareness of social issues. These examples rely on a common process in order to be effective: the ability to engage users and spread moralized content through online networks. Here, we review evidence that expressions of moral emotion play an important role in the spread of moralized content (a phenomenon we call ‘moral contagion’). Next, we propose a psychological model to explain moral contagion. The ‘MAD’ model of moral contagion argues that people have group identity-based motivations to share moral-emotional content; that such content is especially likely to capture our attention; and that the design of social media platforms amplifies our natural motivational and cognitive tendencies to spread such content. We review each component of the model (as well as interactions between components) and raise several novel, testable hypotheses that can spark progress on the scientific investigation of civic engagement and activism, political polarization, propaganda and disinformation, and other moralized behaviors in the digital age.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Brady","given":"William J."},{"family":"Crockett","given":"Molly"},{"family":"Van Bavel","given":"Jay Joseph"}],"DOI":"10.31234/osf.io/pz9g6","genre":"preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,11]]},"publisher":"PsyArXiv","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The MAD Model of Moral Contagion: The role of motivation, attention and design in the spread of moralized content online","title-short":"The MAD Model of Moral Contagion","type":"report","URL":"https://osf.io/pz9g6"},

  {"id":"bratkovicRootsResistanceChange2018","abstract":"In recent years, a paradigm shift in the supreme court’s role from a private to a public purpose has been recognised in many jurisdictions. Due to growing backlogs at supreme courts in many countries, the private purpose of the just and correct resolution of every individual case has given place to a public purpose consisting in safeguarding and promoting the public interest of ensuring uniformity of case law, the development of the law, and offering guidance to lower courts. However, this paradigm shift has met with considerable criticism from a large part of the legal community. It has been argued that litigants will become exposed to judicial arbitrariness and that more restrictive access to the supreme court means less protection of equality before the law. In order to explore the possible roots of the resistance to the change in the supreme court’s role, Faulkner’s polyperspective technique of narration used in the novel The Sound and the Fury might be of some help. The retelling of more or less the same story from the perspective of the individual party, the attorney-at-law, the supreme court and the constitutional court reveals that in favouring the public interest of uniform application of the law some particular interests of all involved have to be suppressed, and the broader picture taken into account.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Bratković","given":"Marko"}],"container-title":"Transformation of Civil Justice","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-319-97358-6_18","editor":[{"family":"Uzelac","given":"Alan"},{"family":"Rhee","given":"Cornelis Hendrik","non-dropping-particle":"van"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-319-97357-9 978-3-319-97358-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","page":"333-347","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Crossref","title":"Roots of the Resistance to the Change in the Supreme Court’s Role","type":"chapter","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-97358-6_18","volume":"70"},
  {"id":"braunFakeNewsReal2019","abstract":"Following the viral spread of hoax political news in the lead-up to the 2016 US presidential election, it's been reported that at least some of the individuals publishing these stories made substantial sums of money—tens of thousands of US dollars—from their efforts. Whether or not such hoax stories are ultimately revealed to have had a persuasive impact on the electorate, they raise important normative questions about the underlying media infrastructures and industries—ad tech firms, programmatic advertising exchanges, etc.—that apparently created a lucrative incentive structure for \"fake news\" publishers. Legitimate ad-supported news organizations rely on the same infrastructure and industries for their livelihood. Thus, as traditional advertising subsidies for news have begun to collapse in the era of online advertising, it's important to understand how attempts to deal with for-profit hoaxes might simultaneously impact legitimate news organizations. Through 20 interviews with stakeholders in online advertising, this study looks at how the programmatic advertising industry understands “fake news,” how it conceptualizes and grapples with the use of its tools by hoax publishers to generate revenue, and how its approach to the issue may ultimately contribute to reshaping the financial underpinnings of the digital journalism industry that depends on the same economic infrastructure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Braun","given":"Joshua A."},{"family":"Eklund","given":"Jessica L."}],"container-title":"Digital Journalism","DOI":"10.1080/21670811.2018.1556314","ISSN":"2167-0811","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,2]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/21670811.2018.1556314","page":"1-21","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Fake News, Real Money: Ad Tech Platforms, Profit-Driven Hoaxes, and the Business of Journalism","title-short":"Fake News, Real Money","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/21670811.2018.1556314","volume":"7"},

To answer this question, we focus on the most commented citizens’ proposal discussed on the Barcelona government’s platform Decidim (i.e., the granting of new licenses for tourist apartments). Our goal is twofold. First, we evaluate via content analysis the deliberative quality of this conversation through a carefully selected system of indicators following the classical literature on deliberation. Second, we examine how deliberative quality criteria evolve through interaction, by introducing the dimension of depth, inspired on social computing research. The findings show that the relation between deliberative quality and depth of conversation is mostly curvilinear. The level of justification decreases as conversations go deeper, whereas the levels of reciprocity and incivility become more important over time before decreasing at a later stage. Overall, we conclude that online citizen deliberation can spontaneously emerge, but additional institutional conditions are required to make it last.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Bravo","given":"Rosa Borge"},{"family":"Balcells","given":"Joan"},{"family":"Padró-Solanet","given":"Albert"}],"container-title":"International Journal of Communication","ISSN":"1932-8036","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,30]]},"language":"en","number":"0","page":"25","source":"ijoc.org","title":"Platform Politics in Europe | A Model for the Analysis of Online Citizen Deliberation: Barcelona Case Study","title-short":"Platform Politics in Europe | A Model for the Analysis of Online Citizen Deliberation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/10805","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"brennan-marquezPlausibleCause2016","abstract":"“Probable cause” is not about probability. It is about plausibility. To determine if an officer has the requisite suspicion to perform a search or seizure, what matters is not the statistical likelihood that a “person, house, paper or effect” is linked to criminal activity. What matters is whether criminal activity provides a convincing explanation of observed facts. For an inference to qualify as plausible, an observer must understand why the inference follows; she must be able to explain its relationship to the facts. Probable inferences, by contrast, do not require explanations. An inference can be probable — in a predictive sense, based on past trends — without a human observer understanding what makes it so. In many cases, plausibility and probability overlap. An inference that accounts for observed facts is often likely to be true, and vice versa. But there is an important sub-set of cases in which the two properties pull apart, raising deep questions about the underpinnings of Fourth Amendment suspicion: inferences generated by predictive algorithms. In this Article, I argue that casting suspicion in terms of plausibility, rather than probability, is both more consistent with established law and crucial to the Fourth Amendment’s normative integrity. Before law enforcement officials may intrude on private life, they must explain why they believe wrongdoing has occurred. This “explanation-giving” requirement has two key virtues. First, it facilitates governance; we cannot effectively regulate what we do not understand. Second, it allows judges to consider the “other side of the story” — the innocent version of events a suspect might offer on her own behalf — before warranting searches and seizures. In closing, I connect these virtues to broader themes of democratic theory. In a free society, legitimacy is not measured solely by outcomes. The exercise of state power must be explained — and the explanations must be responsive both to the democratic community writ large and to the specific individuals whose interests are infringed.","author":[{"family":"Brennan-Marquez","given":"Kiel Robert"}],"event-place":"Rochester, NY","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"publisher":"Social Science Research Network","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","title":"Plausible Cause","title-short":"Plausible Cause","type":"report","URL":"http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2827733"},

  {"id":"brennanDemocracy2016","abstract":"Most people believe democracy is a uniquely just form of government. They believe people have the right to an equal share of political power. And they believe that political participation is good for us—it empowers us, helps us get what we want, and tends to make us smarter, more virtuous, and more caring for one another. These are some of our most cherished ideas about democracy. But, Jason Brennan says, they are all wrong. In this trenchant book, Brennan argues that democracy should be judged by its results—and the results are not good enough. Just as defendants have a right to a fair trial, citizens have a right to competent government. But democracy is the rule of the ignorant and the irrational, and it all too often falls short. Furthermore, no one has a fundamental right to any share of political power, and exercising political power does most of us little good. On the contrary, a wide range of social science research shows that political participation and democratic deliberation actually tend to make people worse—more irrational, biased, and mean. Given this grim picture, Brennan argues that a new system of government—epistocracy, the rule of the knowledgeable—may be better than democracy, and that it’s time to experiment and find out. A challenging critique of democracy and the first sustained defense of the rule of the knowledgeable, Against Democracy is essential reading for scholars and students of politics across the disciplines.","author":[{"family":"Brennan","given":"Jason"}],"ISBN":"1-4008-8293-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"number-of-pages":"304","publisher":"Princeton University Press","title":"Against Democracy","title-short":"Against Democracy","type":"book","URL":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jG8ADAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=brennan+against+democracy&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api"},

Most people believe that every citizen has the civic duty or moral obligation to vote, that any sincere vote is morally acceptable, and that buying, selling, or trading votes is inherently wrong. In this provocative book, Jason Brennan challenges our fundamental assumptions about voting, revealing why it is not a duty for most citizens--in fact, he argues, many people owe it to the rest of us not to vote. Bad choices at the polls can result in unjust laws, needless wars, and calamitous economic policies. Brennan shows why voters have duties to make informed decisions in the voting booth, to base their decisions on sound evidence for what will create the best possible policies, and to promote the common good rather than their own self-interest. They must vote well--or not vote at all. Brennan explains why voting is not necessarily the best way for citizens to exercise their civic duty, and why some citizens need to stay away from the polls to protect the democratic process from their uninformed, irrational, or immoral votes. In a democracy, every citizen has the right to vote. This book reveals why sometimes it's best if they don't.

  {"id":"brettReformingMonetarySanctions","abstract":"In the years since Officer Darren Wilson shot and killed Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, policymakers and advocates have pushed for reforms to both police practices and systems of fines and fees. The connection between fines and fees enforcement tactics and police violence remains an important focus for reforms. Police play a significant role in driving up the volume and amounts of fines and fees imposed, and they play a critical role in city and state collection efforts. The use of police as debt imposers and collectors creates opportunities for police violence—both physical use of force, as well as more nuanced forms of violence through the exertion of coercion, fear, and control. In this piece, I argue that specific policing tactics used to impose and collect fines and fees, and the wide latitude given to police via Fourth Amendment jurisprudence to engage in such tactics, facilitates conditions similar to those in Ferguson and results in unnecessary and oppressive police violence. To combat this, I argue that fines and fees reforms must focus on the role of law enforcement in such systems, and how that role must be greatly limited to prevent additional violence.","author":[{"family":"Brett","given":"Sharon"}],"language":"en","page":"33","source":"Zotero","title":"Reforming Monetary Sanctions, Reducing Police Violence","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"bridyGraduatedResponseTurn2016","abstract":"At the end of 2008, the music industry ended its five-year campaign of litigation against individual peer-to-peer file sharers and announced that it would be shifting its online copyright enforcement efforts to a model known as graduated response. The most widely publicized form of graduated response is a \"three strikes and you're out\" model, in which a user's Internet access is suspended or terminated by his or her ISP following that user's receipt of three successive notices of copyright infringement. As it has been presented by entertainment industry trade groups, the enforcement paradigm embodied in graduated response forgoes litigation and statutory mandates in favor of voluntary cooperation between rights owners and Internet access providers - parties that have long been at loggerheads with each other in the war on piracy.This article seeks to explain, in the context of evolving network management technology and its impact on intermediary liability rules, why the time may be ripe for broadband providers and corporate rights owners to renegotiate their respective roles in the project of online copyright enforcement. Following an analysis of the turn to private ordering and technology-based mechanisms for policing copyrights online, this article proposes a set of principles to guide the implementation of graduated response regimes so that consumers, who have come to rely on uninterrupted Internet access for everything from banking to blogging, do not fall victim to immature filtering technologies and overzealous enforcement.Annemarie BridyProfessor<http://www.uidaho.edu/law/faculty/annemariebridy>|University of Idaho College of Law|PO Box 83720-0051|Boise, ID 83720|Ph. 208.364.4583Affiliate Scholar<https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/about/people/annemarie-bridy>|Stanford Center for Internet and SocietyAffiliate Fellow<http://isp.yale.edu/people-directory?type=19>|Yale Information Society ProjectSSRN<http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=630766>|HeinOnline<http://heinonline.org/HOL/AuthorProfile?collection=journals&search_name=Bridy,%20Annemarie&base=js>|LinkedIn<https://www.linkedin.com/in/annemariebridy>|Twitter<https://twitter.com/AnnemarieBridy>","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Bridy","given":"Annemarie"}],"DOI":"10.31235/osf.io/bk8w2","genre":"preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,7,16]]},"language":"en","publisher":"SocArXiv","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Graduated Response and the Turn to Private Ordering in Online Copyright Enforcement","type":"report","URL":"https://osf.io/bk8w2"},
  {"id":"bridyINERNETPAYMENTBLOCKADES","abstract":"Internet payment blockades are an attempt to enforce intellectual property rights by “following the money” that flows to online merchants who profit from piracy and counterfeiting. Where corporate copyright and trademark owners failed in the legislature and the judiciary to create binding public law requiring payment processors like MasterCard and Visa to act as intellectual property enforcers, “non-regulatory” intervention from the executive branch secured their cooperation as a matter of private ordering. The resulting voluntary best practices agreement prescribes a notice-and-termination protocol that extends the reach of U.S. intellectual property law into cyberspace, to merchants operating “foreign infringing sites.” It also privatizes the adjudication of infringement claims, raising issues of fairness and institutional competence. Like other forms of regulation by online intermediaries, payment blockades are subject to circumvention through disintermediation. Marrying peer-to-peer (P2P) technology with financial transactions, P2P virtual currencies like Bitcoin allow online merchants and their customers to work around payment blockades.","author":[{"family":"Bridy","given":"Annemarie"}],"container-title":"FLORIDA LAW REVIEW","language":"en","page":"46","source":"Zotero","title":"INERNET PAYMENT BLOCKADES","type":"article-journal","volume":"67"},
  {"id":"bridyOnlineCopyrightEnforcement2016","abstract":"This Article examines P2P file sharing and the copyright enforcement problem it has created through the lens of scalability. Part I traces the evolution of peer-to-peer (P2P) networks from Napster to BitTorrent, with a focus on the relative scalability of successive architectures. Part II takes up the difficult question of the scale of P2P infringement and its harms, examining the strategic numbercrunching that underlies industry data on piracy, the government‘s credulous acceptance of that data, and the risk of letting industry hyperbole drive copyright policy and law enforcement priorities. Part III evaluates the efficacy of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) as a policy mechanism for scaling up online copyright enforcement. I argue in Part III that the DMCA has proven to be remarkably scalable for enforcing copyrights in hosted content but has altogether failed to scale in the context of P2P file sharing, leading to the dysfunctional workaround of mass John Doe litigation. Part IV weighs the costs and benefits of more scalable alternatives to mass litigation, including a potential amendment of the DMCA‘s prelitigation subpoena provision and a pair of administrative dispute resolution systems—one hypothetical, the other real—for streamlining adjudication of P2P infringement claims.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Bridy","given":"Annemarie"}],"DOI":"10.31235/osf.io/c92dp","genre":"preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,7,17]]},"language":"en","publisher":"SocArXiv","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Is Online Copyright Enforcement Scalable?","type":"report","URL":"https://osf.io/c92dp"},

  {"id":"brockxStudentCommentatorStudents2012","abstract":"Little is known about students’ comments in student evaluations of teaching. In the current study on around 70% of the SET- surveys received, a comment was written by a student. Most students’ comments deal with, a good combination between theory and practice, the build-up of the course, and whether it is interesting and relevant. They emphasize aspects already asked for in the fixed-ended questions, but also provide information that was not part of the SET-survey. The results of a logistic regression analysis showed a consistency between students’ comments and SET-scores. Surveys that were received with low-SET scores have a larger chance to receive negative comments about various aspects of the course. In general students seems to take their task as a commentator, seriously. As to the content of the comments received, the context plays an important role. This indicates that more research in different contexts is necessary and that one should take into account this context when conducting SET.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Brockx","given":"B."},{"family":"Van Roy","given":"K."},{"family":"Mortelmans","given":"D."}],"collection-title":"International Conference on Education & Educational Psychology (ICEEPSY 2012)","container-title":"Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences","container-title-short":"Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences","DOI":"10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.12.042","ISSN":"1877-0428","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,12,24]]},"page":"1122-1133","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The Student as a Commentator: Students’ Comments in Student Evaluations of Teaching","title-short":"The Student as a Commentator","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042812055024","volume":"69"},

I focus in particular on four insights of this body of black American political thought: that the presumption of dignity is the basis on which citizenship is conferred, while its denial is the justification by which citizenship is withheld; that dignity’s existence within a person is vouchsafed most effectively by indignation, a flash of emotion that arises in response to the insult of its denial; that even though dignity feels woven into one’s innermost being, it is always vulnerable to social denial and therefore stands in need of social confirmation; that indignation can and should be transformed into a self-opposing disposition that resists complacency and seeks continual reconfiguration, or enlargement, of the demos and of its democratic theory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Bromell","given":"Nick"}],"container-title":"Political Theory","container-title-short":"Political Theory","DOI":"10.1177/0090591712470627","ISSN":"0090-5917","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"285-311","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Democratic Indignation: Black American Thought and the Politics of Dignity","title-short":"Democratic Indignation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0090591712470627","volume":"41"},

  {"id":"broniatowskiWeaponizedHealthCommunication2018","abstract":"Objectives. To understand how Twitter bots and trolls (“bots”) promote online health content.Methods. We compared bots’ to average users’ rates of vaccine-relevant messages, which we collected online from July 2014 through September 2017. We estimated the likelihood that users were bots, comparing proportions of polarized and antivaccine tweets across user types. We conducted a content analysis of a Twitter hashtag associated with Russian troll activity.Results. Compared with average users, Russian trolls (χ2(1) = 102.0; P < .001), sophisticated bots (χ2(1) = 28.6; P < .001), and “content polluters” (χ2(1) = 7.0; P < .001) tweeted about vaccination at higher rates. Whereas content polluters posted more antivaccine content (χ2(1) = 11.18; P < .001), Russian trolls amplified both sides. Unidentifiable accounts were more polarized (χ2(1) = 12.1; P < .001) and antivaccine (χ2(1) = 35.9; P < .001). Analysis of the Russian troll hashtag showed that its messages were more political and divisive.Conclusions. Whereas bots that spread malware and unsolicited content disseminated antivaccine messages, Russian trolls promoted discord. Accounts masquerading as legitimate users create false equivalency, eroding public consensus on vaccination.Public Health Implications. Directly confronting vaccine skeptics enables bots to legitimize the vaccine debate. More research is needed to determine how best to combat bot-driven content.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Broniatowski","given":"David A."},{"family":"Jamison","given":"Amelia M."},{"family":"Qi","given":"SiHua"},{"family":"AlKulaib","given":"Lulwah"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Tao"},{"family":"Benton","given":"Adrian"},{"family":"Quinn","given":"Sandra C."},{"family":"Dredze","given":"Mark"}],"container-title":"American Journal of Public Health","container-title-short":"Am J Public Health","DOI":"10.2105/AJPH.2018.304567","ISSN":"0090-0036","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,23]]},"page":"1378-1384","publisher":"American Public Health Association","source":"ajph-aphapublications-org.proxy.lib.uiowa.edu (Atypon)","title":"Weaponized Health Communication: Twitter Bots and Russian Trolls Amplify the Vaccine Debate","title-short":"Weaponized Health Communication","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2018.304567","volume":"108"},
  {"id":"broockmanPredispositionsPoliticalBehavior2019","abstract":"Economic elites regularly seek to exert political influence. But what policies do they support? Many accounts implicitly assume economic elites are homogeneous and that increases in their political power will increase inequality. We shed new light on heterogeneity in economic elites' political preferences, arguing that economic elites from an industry can share distinctive preferences due in part to sharing distinctive predispositions. Consequently, how increases in economic elites' influence affect inequality depends on which industry's elites are gaining influence and which policy issues are at stake. We demonstrate our argument with four original surveys, including the two largest political surveys of American economic elites to date: one of technology entrepreneurs—whose influence is burgeoning—and another of campaign donors. We show that technology entrepreneurs support liberal redistributive, social, and globalistic policies but conservative regulatory policies—a bundle of preferences rare among other economic elites. These differences appear to arise partly from their distinctive predispositions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Broockman","given":"David E."},{"family":"Ferenstein","given":"Gregory"},{"family":"Malhotra","given":"Neil"}],"container-title":"American Journal of Political Science","DOI":"10.1111/ajps.12408","ISSN":"1540-5907","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"212-233","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Predispositions and the Political Behavior of American Economic Elites: Evidence from Technology Entrepreneurs","title-short":"Predispositions and the Political Behavior of American Economic Elites","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajps.12408","volume":"63"},

To contribute to this literature, the current study analyzes qualitative interview data from 25 Black men focused on their self-conceptions of race, stereotyping, and profiling. The findings reveal the men’s perceptions and experiences with racism and stereotyping, the strategies that they employ in response to being stereotyped and profiled, and their reflections on the recent killings of Black men.

  {"id":"brophyBlackPowerPrison2017","abstract":"Black Power in a Prison Library” focuses on a list of ninety books on the black experience in America that were added to the Marion, Ohio Correctional Institution in 1972. It uses the list as a way of gauging what books the plaintiffs (and thus the court) thought were essential to telling the African American experience. And in that way, we can use the list to reconstruct the contours of the bibliographic world of the African American experience in the early 1970s. The list reflects an interest in the history of slavery, the eras of Reconstruction and Jim Crow, literature of the Harlem Renaissance, the 1960s Civil Rights Movement, and contemporary works on Black Power. Notably thin is prison literature. Together, the books help form a picture of the critique of law made by Black Power writers and the ways those claims built on historical, sociological, and Civil Rights literature. The book list, thus, suggests some of the ways that books propagated and gave definition to Black Power claims.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Brophy","given":"Alfred L."}],"container-title":"SSRN Electronic Journal","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.2901475","ISSN":"1556-5068","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","source":"Crossref","title":"Black Power in a Prison Library","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2901475"},

Her focus is on the dignity harms to South Africans over centuries, such as denial of citizenship, that accompanied the theft of their land. I focus here on one grotesque episode of violence, the Tulsa race riot of 1921, to gauge dignity takings in a US context. Thousands were, in the parlance of the times, run out of town in a “negro drive.” They lost property, but also their community, and they could not assert their rights after the riot. This article turns to the ways in which African Americans in Oklahoma obtained rights through the courts that should have been protected around the time of the riot.

Constitutions have been issued to address a varying range of concerns: international, domestic and internal to the state itself. This article traces the enabling aspects of Arab constitutions over the past century and a half, concentrating on the very recent past. In some ways, the past couple of decades have seen a deﬁnite (if limited) upsurge of interest in constitutionalism in the Arab world. Recent constitutional innovations have stressed regularization of authority, bounded democracy and a modest increase in the autonomy of some constitutional structures (especially courts and parliaments). Yet that change should not obscure an underlying continuity. For while the Arab world has joined the global trend toward greater interest in constitutional structures, the changes of the past few decades have not reversed the patterns of the past: constitutions remain politically enabling documents.","author":[{"family":"Brown","given":"Nathan J"}],"issue":"1","language":"en","page":"20","source":"Zotero","title":"Regimes Reinventing Themselves","type":"article-journal","volume":"18"},

Four organising questions are posed, concerning: (i) the compatibility of the ‘instrumentalist’ nature of technological management with the Rule of Law; (ii) the way in which compliance with the Rule of Law might function as the test of whether the use of technological management involves an abuse of regulatory power; (iii) the applicability of the spirit of the Fullerian principles of legality to the use of measures of technological management; and (iv) the further conditions that a moral community might wish to specify (as part of the Rule of Law compact between regulators and regulatees) with regard to distinctively the use of technological management.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Brownsword","given":"Roger"}],"container-title":"Law, Innovation and Technology","DOI":"10.1080/17579961.2016.1161891","ISSN":"1757-9961","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,1,2]]},"page":"100-140","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Technological management and the Rule of Law","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/17579961.2016.1161891","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"brugnoliRecursivePatternsOnline2019","abstract":"Despite their playful purpose social media changed the way users access information, debate, and form their opinions. Recent studies, indeed, showed that users online tend to promote their favored narratives and thus to form polarized groups around a common system of beliefs. Confirmation bias helps to account for users decisions about whether to spread content, thus creating informational cascades within identifiable communities. At the same time, aggregation of favored information within those communities reinforces selective exposure and group polarization. Along this path, through a thorough quantitative analysis we approach connectivity patterns over 1.2M of Facebook users engaged with two very conflicting narratives: scientific and conspiracy news. Analyzing such data, we quantitatively investigate the effect of two mechanisms (namely challenge avoidance and reinforcement seeking) behind confirmation bias, one of the major drivers of human behavior in social media. We find that challenge avoidance mechanism triggers the emergence of two distinct and polarized groups of users (i.e., echo chambers) who also tend to be surrounded by friends having similar systems of beliefs. Through a network based approach, we show how the reinforcement seeking mechanism limits the influence of neighbors and primarily drives the selection and diffusion of contents even among like-minded users, thus fostering the formation of highly polarized sub-clusters within the same echo chamber. Finally, we show that polarized users reinforce their preexisting beliefs by leveraging the activity of their like-minded neighbors, and this trend grows with the user engagement suggesting how peer influence acts as a support for reinforcement seeking.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Brugnoli","given":"Emanuele"},{"family":"Cinelli","given":"Matteo"},{"family":"Quattrociocchi","given":"Walter"},{"family":"Scala","given":"Antonio"}],"container-title":"Physics and Society","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,30]]},"page":"19","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Recursive patterns in online echo chambers","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.11583"},

We know little, however, about how aggressive policing is experienced across gender by adolescents in these neighborhoods. The authors argue that important insights can be gained by examining the perspectives of African American youths and draw from in-depth interviews with youths in St. Louis, Missouri, to investigate how gender shapes interactions with the police. The comparative analysis reveals important gendered facets of African American adolescents' experiences with and expectations of law enforcement. Young men described being treated routinely as suspects regardless of their involvement in delinquency and also reported police violence. Young women typically described being stopped for curfew violations but also expressed concerns about police sexual misconduct. This study highlights the differential harms of urban policing for African American young women and men and highlights the need for systematic attention to the intersections of race and gender in research on criminal justice practices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Brunson","given":"Rod K."},{"family":"Miller","given":"Jody"}],"container-title":"Gender & Society","container-title-short":"Gender & Society","DOI":"10.1177/0891243206287727","ISSN":"0891-2432","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"531-552","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Gender, Race, and Urban Policing: The Experience of African American Youths","title-short":"Gender, Race, and Urban Policing","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0891243206287727","volume":"20"},

  {"id":"bryant-davisTraumaLensPolice2017","abstract":"Police violence against racial and ethnic minorities has been researched through the lens of multiple social science disciplines including psychology. Within psychology, the study of trauma lends itself to understanding the dynamics of unjustified violence perpetrated by some law enforcement agents. These acts of aggression are not only examples of interpersonal trauma but also the trauma of racism, which is examined through the lens of intergenerational trauma, racist-incident–based trauma, and complex trauma. There is a history of violence against racial and ethnic minorities that contextualizes the traumatic experience of police violence. Additionally, the framework of trauma illuminates the causes and consequences of police brutality as a racist-incident trauma. Finally, survivors of police violence targeting racial and ethnic minorities are often persons who have been exposed to multiple traumas resulting in a cumulative effect. Filling a current gap in the literature, we discuss the clinical implications of applying trauma theories to police violence, as well as diverse ways racially and ethnically marginalized persons have coped with and resisted these acts. There is attention given to the need to attend to the intersecting identities of persons who are targeted such as ethnic minority women. Finally, we describe the need for further study of this complex and devastating phenomenon.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Bryant‐Davis","given":"Thema"},{"family":"Adams","given":"Tyonna"},{"family":"Alejandre","given":"Adriana"},{"family":"Gray","given":"Anthea A."}],"container-title":"Journal of Social Issues","DOI":"10.1111/josi.12251","ISSN":"1540-4560","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","page":"852-871","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The Trauma Lens of Police Violence against Racial and Ethnic Minorities","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/josi.12251","volume":"73"},

Wilson Carey McWilliams deviated from this view by suggesting that Douglass's experience as a slave led him to appreciate human interdependence and reject liberalism in favor of fraternal communitarianism. In this essay, Douglass's response to the problem of slavery is examined in order to demonstrate that both the liberal and the fraternal readings are correct. Douglass's aims were undoubtedly liberal, but he thought these aims could only be realized in a community of individuals who felt strong obligations to one another. As a statesman, Douglass was confronted with the challenge of convincing free people that they ought to care about those who are enslaved.

Douglass relied on this account to argue that human beings have certain rights that ought to be protected, that they have certain duties to others, and that they can demonstrate their dignity by using their capacities in virtuous ways. Douglass’s philosophy of dignity lends support to J.

  {"id":"buchananHowChooseLeast2012","abstract":"The federal statute known as the \"debt ceiling\" limits total borrowing by the United States. Congress has repeatedly raised the ceiling to authorize necessary borrowing, but a political standoff in 2011 nearly made it impossible to borrow funds to meet obligations that Congress had affirmed earlier that very year. Some commentators urged President Obama to ignore the debt ceiling, while others responded that such borrowing would violate the separation of powers and therefore that the president should refuse to spend appropriated funds. This Article analyzes the choice the president nearly faced in summer 2011, and which he or a successor may yet face, as a \"trilemma\" offering three unconstitutional options: ignore the debt ceiling and unilaterally issue new bonds, thus usurping Congress's borrowing power; unilaterally raise taxes, thus usurping Congress's taxing power; or unilaterally cut spending, thus usurping Congress's spending power. We argue that the president should choose the \"least unconstitutional\" course &#x2014; here, ignoring the debt ceiling. We argue further, though more tentatively, that if the bond markets would render such debt inadequate to close the gap, the president should unilaterally increase taxes rather than cut spending. We then use the debt ceiling impasse to develop general criteria for political actors to choose among unconstitutional options. We emphasize three principles derived from a famous speech by President Lincoln: 1) minimize the unconstitutional assumption of power; 2) minimize sub-constitutional harm; and 3) preserve, to the extent possible, the ability of other actors to undo or remedy constitutional violations.","author":[{"family":"Buchanan","given":"Neil H."},{"family":"Dorf","given":"Michael C."}],"container-title":"Columbia Law Review","ISSN":"00101958","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"page":"1175-1243","title":"How to Choose the Least Unconstitutional Option: LEssons for the President (and Others) from the Debt Ceiling Standoff","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/41708172","volume":"112"},

Overall, strong positive associations emerged among online commenting frequency, trolling enjoyment, and troll identity, pointing to a common construct underlying the measures. Both studies revealed similar patterns of relations between trolling and the Dark Tetrad of personality: trolling correlated positively with sadism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism, using both enjoyment ratings and identity scores. Of all personality measures, sadism showed the most robust associations with trolling and, importantly, the relationship was specific to trolling behavior. Enjoyment of other online activities, such as chatting and debating, was unrelated to sadism.

In this paper, we address these questions using tweets that mention the two presidential candidates sampled at the daily level, the news content mentioned in such tweets, and open-ended responses from nationally representative telephone interviews. The results of our analysis highlight various important lessons for news consumers and journalists. We find that (i.) traditional news producers outperformed fake news producers in aggregate, (ii.) the prevalence of content produced by fake news publishers increased over the course of the campaign-particularly among tweets that mentioned Clinton, and (iii.) changes in such prevalence were closely following changes in net Clinton favorability. Turning to content, we (iv.) identify similarities and differences in agenda setting by fake and traditional news media and show that (v.) information individuals most commonly reported to having read, seen or heard about the candidates was more closely aligned with content produced by fake news outlets than traditional news outlets, in particular for information Republican voters retained about Clinton.

The article concludes by emphasizing the urgent need for both the study and practice of digital journalism in the public interest, especially in the context of an increasingly platformed and closed media system.

I suggest that consideration and assessment of the origins of the concept of the Rule of Law not only matters, but also that it is a practice that is often neglected. Further, I suggest our failure to take account of the origins of the Rule of Law—by continuing to simply innovate around the idea of the contemporary understanding of the concept—limits the concept’s future development and will, potentially, not reflect faithfully the ideas from which our contemporary understanding of the concept is ultimately derived. As a result of this failure, we risk the (unintentional) imposition of a selective approach in the interpretation and application of the concept of the Rule of Law in the future. Increasing our focus on the origins of the Rule of Law will not only illuminate the rationale for and behind the operation of the concept, but it will also expose aspects of the concept that are no longer considered or included—in contemporary conceptions of the idea—and will ensure our future solutions are not curtailed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Burgess","given":"Paul"}],"container-title":"Hague Journal on the Rule of Law","container-title-short":"Hague J Rule Law","DOI":"10.1007/s40803-017-0057-y","ISSN":"1876-4053","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"195-209","source":"Springer Link","title":"Neglecting the History of the Rule of Law: (Unintended) Conceptual Eugenics","title-short":"Neglecting the History of the Rule of Law","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40803-017-0057-y","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"burgessProblemsSolutionsChange2019","abstract":"The Rule of Law is one of the most important, and most contested, \npolitical concepts. The ideas of thinkers—who are frequently taken to be \nresponsible for canonical statements relating to the Rule of Law—are \nfrequently used to illustrate the existence of similarities and differences that \nboth identify what the Rule of Law is and delineate the conceptual boundaries \nof the concept. In citing these thinkers, the underlying assumption is that the \nRule of Law can be seen as a single, diachronically conceivable, concept that \nhas evolved over time. I question both of these practices. Considering Rule of \nLaw conceptions in a superficial sense—by considering only thinkers’ accounts \nin the absence of their authoring context—fails to appreciate nuances and \ninflections that can fundamentally alter perceived similarities or differences; \nwhere various canonical accounts can no longer be seen as reflecting the \nsame ideas, the assumption of a single, evolving, idea of the concept of the \nRule of Law as drawn in contemporary conceptual discourse cannot be \nsustained. \nI conduct a contextualist examination of two accounts frequently \nassociated with the idea of the Rule of Law: Hobbes’s Leviathan and Locke’s \nTwo Treatises of Government. To place these in context, I adopt a problem / \nsolution approach. I consider their texts as reflecting solutions to problems \nthat existed in their societies at the time they were writing. To expose the \nassociated problems, I consider pamphlets that were popular at that time. By \nclearly identifying and associating the Rule of Law solutions with the relevant \nsocietal problems, a more nuanced appreciation of the accounts is achieved. \nBy identifying inflections in Rule of Law solutions, it becomes possible to \ndisambiguate between superficially similar ideas. By disambiguating in this \nway—and by illustrating superficially similar accounts are fundamentally \ndifferent in their nature—I argue there is no necessary conceptual connection \nbetween the Rule of Law accounts provided by Hobbes and Locke. I also \nargue that this difference is sufficient to show that, at least between these two \n‘canonical’ accounts, the assumption that the Rule of Law has evolved cannot \nhold; change across Hobbes’s and Locke’s conceptions of the Rule of Law has \noccurred not by evolution, but by revolution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Burgess","given":"Paul"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,9]]},"language":"en","source":"www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk","title":"Problems and solutions of change in conceptions of the rule of law in the seventeenth century: evolution or revolution?","title-short":"Problems and solutions of change in conceptions of the rule of law in the seventeenth century","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/35605"},
  {"id":"burgessRuleLawContestedness2017","abstract":"In assessing compliance with the Rule of Law, the contested nature of the concept renders the use of a single theorist’s conception or, alternatively, the adoption of a hybrid conception open to criticism. There is no settled and practical way to determine Rule of Law non-compliance. It is argued that by looking behind the concept’s contestedness, Rule of Law non-compliance can be identified. The fundamental needs undergirding canonical conceptions are used to identify common elements of the Rule of Law. By taking this approach, two necessary Rule of Law elements are distilled: Comprehension; and, Procedural Pellucidity. As a result of their elemental nature, an inability to comply with the elements reflects a total inability to satisfy the Rule of Law regardless of the canonical conception preferred. The methodology suggested provides a practical – theory agnostic – way to identify Rule of Law non-compliance beyond the concept’s inherent contestedness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Burgess","given":"Paul"}],"container-title":"Jurisprudence","DOI":"10.1080/20403313.2017.1341203","ISSN":"2040-3313","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,2]]},"page":"480-500","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The rule of law: beyond contestedness","title-short":"The rule of law","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/20403313.2017.1341203","volume":"8"},
  {"id":"burgessRuleLawUS2016","abstract":"In this brief note I question, in part, the justification for thinking that the US Supreme Court should – in a recent Opinion – consider the Rule of Law. I further consider whether it did in fact fail to do so. I take an introspective approach to this question and explore the validity of us – Rule of Law-people – taking a Rule of Law-centric view of the world. In this respect, I do not forensically examine the Court’s opinion nor do I question its general accuracy or acceptability. Instead, I consider the omission of any mention of the Rule of Law in terms of both the Court’s presentation of an argument and our consideration – as readers of a journal with a specific Rule of Law-centric focus – of the same. I conclude that, whilst it is possible to identify Rule of Law related issues almost anywhere, and it may be problematic to seek to do so in every instance, there are some places where it is appropriate to do so.

We then describe linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for separable and non-separable data, working through a non-trivial example in detail. We describe a mechanical analogy, and discuss when SVM solutions are unique and when they are global. We describe how support vector training can be practically implemented, and discuss in detail the kernel mapping technique which is used to construct SVM solutions which are nonlinear in the data. We show how Support Vector machines can have very large (even infinite) VC dimension by computing the VC dimension for homogeneous polynomial and Gaussian radial basis function kernels. While very high VC dimension would normally bode ill for generalization performance, and while at present there exists no theory which shows that good generalization performance is guaranteed for SVMs, there are several arguments which support the observed high accuracy of SVMs, which we review. Results of some experiments which were inspired by these arguments are also presented. We give numerous examples and proofs of most of the key theorems.

  {"id":"burkAuthorizationGovernanceVirtual2010","abstract":"Although a variety of formal and informal mechanisms govern behavior in virtual worlds, the proprietors of such worlds increasingly have relied upon formal legal claims to sanction undesired user behavior. A range of such legal claims might be asserted in different factual situations: copyright infringement, or trespass to computers, or circumvention of technical protections. But each of these claims relies upon the authorization status of the targeted user. Authorization is largely an incident of the virtual world proprietor's Terms of Service (ToS). Thus, the ToS is increasingly regarded as a license to access the proprietor's servers; violation of the ToS annuls authorization to access the servers. The result is that any misbehavior by users, in violation of the ToS, can be recast as a violation of copyright, or trespass, or technical circumvention laws, even if the undesired behavior has little bearing on the variety legal claim asserted.  This mutation of legal claims is troubling, not only from the standpoint of legal policy, but as a social policy to govern virtual worlds.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Burk","given":"Dan L."}],"container-title":"First Monday","DOI":"10.5210/fm.v15i5.2967","ISSN":"13960466","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"language":"en","source":"journals.uic.edu","title":"Authorization and governance in virtual worlds","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2967","volume":"15"},

There is a clear philosophy, a sound criterion based in information theory, and a rigorous statistical foundation for AIC. AIC can be justified as Bayesian using a “savvy” prior on models that is a function of sample size and the number of model parameters. Furthermore, BIC can be derived as a non-Bayesian result. Therefore, arguments about using AIC versus BIC for model selection cannot be from a Bayes versus frequentist perspective. The philosophical context of what is assumed about reality, approximating models, and the intent of model-based inference should determine whether AIC or BIC is used.

  {"id":"buschSelfRegulationRegulatoryIntermediation","abstract":"Digital platforms are not only market intermediaries between different groups of platform users. They are also providers of governance mechanisms that are essential for the functioning of digital markets. Moreover, public regulators are increasingly relying on platforms as regulatory intermediaries, drawing on their superior operational capacities, data pools and direct access to platform users. A future EU regulatory policy for the platform economy should consider these multiple roles of digital platforms. Considering the rapid pace of technological innovation and the variety of different business models, the regulatory framework should be flexible enough to adapt to technological and economic developments. The chapter suggests a combination of principles-based legislation and ‘techno-legal standards’ elaborated by European standard-setting organisations involving all relevant stakeholders. A model for co-regulation could be the ‘New Approach’, which has been tried and tested over many years in the field of product safety and which could be transferred to platform regulation.","author":[{"family":"Busch","given":"Christoph"}],"language":"en","page":"17","source":"Zotero","title":"Self-Regulation and Regulatory Intermediation in the Platform Economy","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"caloTrickingRobotHacking2018","abstract":"The term “hacking” has come to signify breaking into a computer system. A number of local, national, and international laws seek to hold hackers accountable for breaking into computer systems to steal information or disrupt their operation. Other laws and standards incentivize private firms to use best practices in securing computers against attack.   A new set of techniques, aimed not at breaking into computers but at manipulating the increasingly intelligent machine learning models that control them, may force law and legal institutions to reevaluate the very nature of hacking. Three of the authors have shown, for example, that it is possible to use one’s knowledge of a system to fool a driverless car into perceiving a stop sign as a speed limit. Other techniques build secret blind spots into machine learning systems or seek to reconstruct the private data that went into their training.   The unfolding renaissance in artificial intelligence (AI), coupled with an almost parallel discovery of its vulnerabilities, requires a reexamination of what it means to “hack,” i.e., to compromise a computer system. The stakes are significant. Unless legal and societal frameworks adjust, the consequences of misalignment between law and practice include inadequate coverage of crime,  missing or skewed security incentives, and the prospect of chilling critical security research. This last one is particularly dangerous in light of the important role researchers can play in revealing the biases, safety limitations, and opportunities for mischief that the mainstreaming of artificial intelligence appears to present.   The authors of this essay represent an interdisciplinary team of experts in machine learning, computer security, and law. Our aim is to introduce the law and policy community within and beyond academia to the ways adversarial machine learning (ML) alter the nature of hacking and with it the cybersecurity landscape. Using the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 — the paradigmatic federal anti-hacking law — as a case study, we mean to evidence the burgeoning disconnect between law and technical practice. And we hope to explain what is at stake should we fail to address the uncertainty that flows from the prospect that hacking now includes tricking.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Calo","given":"Ryan"},{"family":"Evtimov","given":"Ivan"},{"family":"Fernandes","given":"Earlence"},{"family":"Kohno","given":"Tadayoshi"},{"family":"O'Hair","given":"David"}],"event":"We Robot 2018","event-place":"Rochester, NY","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,27]]},"language":"en","note":"Legal Studies Research Paper No. 2018-05","publisher":"Social Science Research Network","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"papers.ssrn.com","title":"Is Tricking a Robot Hacking?","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3150530"},

Second, since different processes might conceivably play at different levels of government, we exploit the larger sample to separately analyse the determinants of voter turnout in national versus subnational elections.

It argues that such a conception, formulated in opposition to the arbitrary rule of man, was to a large extent consistent with modern ideas of the rule of law as a constraint to political power, and to their Fullerian requirements of formal legality, as well as to requirements of due process. The article then analyses how this ideal was formulated in the Archaic period, and how it became a key feature of Greek identity. Finally, it argues that in the fifth and fourth centuries BCE it came to be used as the measure of the legitimacy of Greek political systems: democracy and oligarchy, as they engaged in an ideological battle, were judged as legitimate (and desirable) or illegitimate (and undesirable) on the basis of their conformity with a shared ideal of the rule of law.

  {"id":"cantarellaDoesFakeNews2019","abstract":"Over the last decade, the erosion of trust in public institutions and traditional media sources have been proceeding in parallel. As recent developments in media consumption have led to a proliferation of politically charged online misinformation, it is no wonder that many have been questioning whether the spread of fake news has affected the results of recent elections, contributing to the growth of populist party platforms. In this work, we aim to quantify this impact by focusing on the causal effect of the spread of misinformation over electoral outcomes in the 2018 Italian General elections. We exploit the presence of Italian and German linguistic groups in the Trento and Bolzano/Bozen autonomous provinces as an exogenous source of variation, assigning individuals into distinct filter bubbles each differently exposed to misinformation. To do so, we introduce a novel index based on text mining techniques to measure populism. Using this approach, we analyse the social media content of each party and their leaders over the course of the electoral campaign for the 2013 and 2018 elections. We then collect electoral and socio-demographic data from the region and, after constructing a proxy for exposition to misinformation, we measure the change in populist vote across the two groups in-between the two general elections, using a combination of difference-in-difference and two-stagesleast- squares inference methods. Our results indicate that misinformation had a negligible and non-significant effect on populist vote in Trentino and South Tyrol during the Italian 2018 general elections.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Cantarella","given":"Michele"},{"family":"Fraccaroli","given":"Nicolo'"},{"family":"Volpe","given":"Roberto"}],"collection-title":"Department of Economics (DEMB)","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,6]]},"language":"en","number":"0146","publisher":"University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Department of Economics \"Marco Biagi\"","source":"ideas.repec.org","title":"Does fake news affect voting behaviour?","type":"report","URL":"https://ideas.repec.org/p/mod/depeco/0146.html"},

  {"id":"carcelloCEOINVOLVEMENTSELECTING","abstract":"Research finds independent audit committees and audit committee financial experts are generally effective in monitoring the financial reporting and auditing processes. However, not all audit committees that appear in form to be independent are in fact actually independent, and not all financial experts with similar backgrounds and credentials are equally effective. CEO involvement in the board selection process can affect whether an audit committee substantively functions as an independent one. We use financial statement restatements to examine whether the benefits of having an independent and expert audit committee are diminished, or even eliminated, when the CEO is involved in the selection of board members. Our results provide some evidence that the monitoring benefits of having an independent and expert audit committee are only maintained when the CEO is not formally involved in selecting board members, although our proxy for CEO involvement in the director selection process is likely subject to some measurement error. Further, we find that these results appear to be driven by the more severe restatements, including misstatements in conjunction with fraudulent financial reporting. In addition, we find that our results continue to apply in the post-SOX period, a period where we have a more exact measure of CEO involvement in the director selection process. Finally, we find that the stock market’s negative reaction to a restatement is mitigated only when the audit committee is independent and the CEO was not involved in selecting board members.","author":[{"family":"Carcello","given":"Joseph V"},{"family":"Professor","given":"Young"},{"family":"Neal","given":"Terry L"},{"family":"Palmrose","given":"Zoe-Vonna"},{"family":"Scholz","given":"Susan"}],"language":"en","page":"54","source":"Zotero","title":"CEO INVOLVEMENT IN SELECTING BOARD MEMBERS, AUDIT COMMITTEE EFFECTIVENESS, AND RESTATEMENTS","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"cardenalEchochambersOnlineNews2019a","abstract":"Whether people live in echo-chambers when they consume political information online has been the subject of much academic and public debate. This article contributes to this debate combining survey and web-tracking online data from Spain, a country known for its high political parallelism. We find that users spend more time in outlets of their political leanings but, generally, they engage in considerable cross-partisan media exposure, especially those in the left. In addition, we use a quasi experiment to test how major news events affect regular patterns of news consumption, and particularly, selective exposure. We find that the nature of news explains changes in users’ overall consumption behaviour, but this has less to do with the type of event than with the interest it arouses. More importantly, we find that users become more polarized along party lines as the level of news consumption and interest for news increases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Cardenal","given":"Ana S"},{"family":"Aguilar-Paredes","given":"Carlos"},{"family":"Cristancho","given":"Camilo"},{"family":"Majó-Vázquez","given":"Sílvia"}],"container-title":"European Journal of Communication","container-title-short":"European Journal of Communication","DOI":"10.1177/0267323119844409","ISSN":"0267-3231","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,23]]},"language":"en","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Echo-chambers in online news consumption: Evidence from survey and navigation data in Spain","title-short":"Echo-chambers in online news consumption","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0267323119844409"},
  {"id":"careyParallelRhetoricsElla2014","abstract":"Scholars have done much to uncover the contributions of civil rights organizer Ella Baker. Her invitational rhetoric has been their primary focus. The titles of honor bestowed upon Baker say very little about her rhetorical discourse beyond this focus.

By examining a body of work that includes two Baker primary sources, pertinent quotes from several of her speeches, and several other sources, I substantiate my argument that Baker did not employ invitational rhetoric exclusively but often projected it along parallel paths with other types of rhetoric as she fought against patriarchy and sexism as a civil rights activist.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Carey","given":"Mittie K."}],"container-title":"Southern Communication Journal","DOI":"10.1080/1041794X.2013.847478","ISSN":"1041-794X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,1,1]]},"note":"_eprint: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/1041794X.2013.847478","page":"27-40","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The Parallel Rhetorics of Ella Baker","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1041794X.2013.847478","volume":"79"},

Some researchers have suggested that ‘SET deniers’ resist SETs because of their own poor SET results. To test this hypothesis, I analysed essays by 230 SET researchers (170 lead authors) and classified the researchers as having negative, neutral or positive attitudes towards SETs. I retrieved their RateMyProfessors.com (RMP) scores and, using logistic regression, found that lead authors with negative attitudes towards SETs were 14 times more likely to score below an estimated RMP average than lead authors with positive attitudes towards SETs. Co-authors and researchers with neutral attitudes, on the other hand, did not significantly differ from the RMP average. These results suggest that personal attitudes towards SETs may drive research findings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Carlozzi","given":"Michael"}],"container-title":"Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education","DOI":"10.1080/02602938.2017.1348465","ISSN":"0260-2938","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,4,3]]},"page":"359-368","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Rate my attitude: research agendas and RateMyProfessor scores","title-short":"Rate my attitude","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/02602938.2017.1348465","volume":"43"},
  {"id":"carlsonFakeNewsInformational2020","abstract":"A persistent story about the 2016 US presidential election was the preponderance of fake news stories on social media, and on Facebook in particular, that had no basis in fact but were wholly concocted to quickly amass clicks that could be converted into advertising revenues. This study steps outside of arguments about the spread or efficacy of fake news to instead interrogate its symbolic dimensions and its meaning for both journalism and the larger system of political communication. To conceptualize the role of fake news as a particular symbol, this paper approaches the journalistic condemnation of fake news as an ‘informational moral panic.’ This concept builds off Cohen’s classic formulation of moral panics as public anxiety that a particular social threat will lead to declining standards. The ability to define a phenomenon as an informational moral panic is an exercise in cultural power that ascribes deviancy to particular actors while validating others. In the case of fake news, the anxiety is not so much directed toward a particular group but aimed at the larger transformation of informational spaces made possible by social media. An examination of journalists’ responses in the US press during November 2016 reveals four domains of focus ‒ production, platform, subsidy, and consumption – each with its own narratives of blame and remedy. Fake news becomes a particular signifier that condenses broader concerns surrounding the eroding boundaries of traditional journalistic channels, click-driven news, the extension of mediated voices, and the growing role of social media in news distribution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Carlson","given":"Matt"}],"container-title":"Information, Communication & Society","DOI":"10.1080/1369118X.2018.1505934","ISSN":"1369-118X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,23]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2018.1505934","page":"374-388","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Fake news as an informational moral panic: the symbolic deviancy of social media during the 2016 US presidential election","title-short":"Fake news as an informational moral panic","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2018.1505934","volume":"23"},

  {"id":"carpiniDigitalMediaDemocratic2019","abstract":"The revolution in digital communications has altered the relationship between citizens and political elites, with important implications for democracy. As new information ecosystems have evolved, as unforeseen examples of their positive and negative consequences have emerged, and as theorizing, data, and research methods have expanded and improved, the central question has shifted from if the digital information environment is good or bad for democratic politics to how and in what contexts particular attributes of this environment are having an influence. It is only through the careful analysis of specific cases that we can begin to build a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the role of digital media in democratic theory and practice. The essays in Digital Media and Democratic Futures focus on a variety of information and communication technologies, politically relevant actors, substantive issues, and digital political practices, doing so from distinct theoretical perspectives and methodological approaches. Individually, each of these case studies provides deep insights into the complex and context-dependent relationship between media and democracy. Collectively, they show that there is no single outcome for democracy in the digital age, only a range of possible futures. Contributors: Rena Bivens, Michael X.

They start with a foundational question: Can international courts affect how international law is implemented? In this review, we lay out four of the most common theoretical arguments for why international courts matter. We then interrogate these accounts. In particular, we examine their views on how much inﬂuence courts have and what the likely welfare consequences are for the signatories of an agreement. In so doing, we identify critical conditions that must obtain for court inﬂuence under each of the arguments. We then bring more recent scholarship to bear on the plausibility of these conditions. In particular, we examine what research on the structure of law, the preferences of judges, and institutional design implies about the efﬁcacy of international courts based on the four foundational arguments. We conclude with suggestions for future research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Carrubba","given":"Clifford J."},{"family":"Gabel","given":"Matthew"}],"container-title":"Annual Review of Political Science","DOI":"10.1146/annurev-polisci-051215-022917","ISSN":"1094-2939, 1545-1577","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,11]]},"language":"en","page":"55-73","source":"Crossref","title":"International Courts: A Theoretical Assessment","title-short":"International Courts","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-polisci-051215-022917","volume":"20"},
  {"id":"carrubbaModelEndogenousDevelopment2009","abstract":"Why do sets of sovereign governments create judicial institutions and grant these institutions the power to rule their actions invalid? Once such a court is created, under what conditions is that court able to rule against these governments and get compliance with their rulings? Finally, how might the influence of the court change over time? This study presents a general theory of judicial institutions that provides a unified answer to these three questions. I argue that governments create judicial institutions to help solve collective action problems endemic to operating under a common regulatory regime. Once established, a court in its institutional “infancy” is capable of facilitating compliance with that regulatory regime's rules but only consistent with the purpose for which the governments created the court. And finally, once the court has earned the trust of a government's public, its ability to enforce the regulatory regime's rules qualitatively expands. In demonstrating this last point, I derive how and why publics can rationally come to believe that supporting a court, if there was a conflict between its government and the court, would be in that public's interest.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Carrubba","given":"Clifford James"}],"container-title":"The Journal of Politics","DOI":"10.1017/s002238160809004x","ISSN":"0022-3816","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"page":"55-69","source":"JSTOR","title":"A Model of the Endogenous Development of Judicial Institutions in Federal and International Systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1017/s002238160809004x","volume":"71"},

In the author's view, this is possible if, first, discretion is conceived through the metaphor of a dialogue between rulers and ruled; and, second, we endorse a substantive understanding of the rule of law that views all three constituents of the state – legislative, judicial, and executive branches – as involved in the project of preventing arbitrary action by public powers. The article explores these dynamics in the concrete setting of the author's experience as associate dean of a law school, in order both to see how the theoretical model of dialogue translates into practice and to identify the particular aspects of the theory that might require further inquiry and empirical research., Cet article examine la relation entre la discrétion administrative et la primauté du droit. L'auteure démontre comment la discrétion administrative, conçue correctement, est non seulement compatible avec une compréhension particulière du principe de la primauté du droit, mais peut aussi devenir un véhicule permettant au pouvoir exécutif d'exprimer son engagement envers ce principe. Selon l'auteure, ceci est possible, premièrement, si la discrétion est conçue selon la métaphore du «dialogue» entre le dirigeant et le dirigé et, deuxièmement, si une compréhension substantive de la primauté du droit est mise de l'avant, à savoir une définition qui considère les trois éléments constitutifs de l'État (les sphères législative, judiciaire et exécutive) comme étant impliqués dans la prévention des actions arbitraires de la part des pouvoirs publics. L'auteure explore ces dynamiques dans le contexte concret de ses expériences en tant que vice-doyenne d'une faculté de droit.

The evidence from three modern waves suggests that stability rests on economic growth, strong states, and liberal institutions. But can we secure democratic stability beyond liberalism? This question is relevant to those developing countries that have little hope, and perhaps little interest in liberal democracy. But it is also increasingly relevant to those developed nations where the achievements of the twentieth-century liberal order are being eroded. This article takes a fresh look at democratic stability by reviewing the evidence from the last two and a half millennia. Particular attention is devoted to the case of ancient Athens, which highlights the importance of alignment between shared norms and appropriately designed institutions. Athens’ case suggests that goods that we usually associate with modern liberal democracy do not necessarily rely on a given set of values and do not have a unique institutional manifestation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Carugati","given":"Federica"}],"container-title":"Annual Review of Political Science","container-title-short":"Annu.

Managing boundaries between disciplines, across scales of geography and jurisdiction, and between different forms of knowledge is also often critical to transferring information. The research presented in this paper finds that information requires three (not mutually exclusive) attributes – salience, credibility, and legitimacy – and that what makes boundary crossing difficult is that actors on different sides of a boundary perceive and value salience, credibility, and legitimacy differently. Presenting research on water management regimes in the United States, international agricultural research systems, El Niño forecasting systems in the Pacific and southern Africa, and fisheries in the North Atlantic, this paper explores: 1) how effective boundary work involves creating salient, credible, and legitimate information simultaneously for multiple audiences; 2) the thresholds, complementarities and tradeoffs between salience, credibility, and legitimacy when crossing boundaries; and 3) propositions for institutional mechanisms in boundary organizations which effectively balance tradeoffs, take advantage on complementarities, and reach thresholds of salience, credibility, and legitimacy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Cash","given":"David"},{"family":"Clark","given":"William C."},{"family":"Alcock","given":"Frank"},{"family":"Dickson","given":"Nancy"},{"family":"Eckley","given":"Noelle"},{"family":"J�ger","given":"Jill"}],"container-title":"SSRN Electronic Journal","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.372280","ISSN":"1556-5068","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003]]},"language":"en","source":"Crossref","title":"Salience, Credibility, Legitimacy and Boundaries: Linking Research, Assessment and Decision Making","title-short":"Salience, Credibility, Legitimacy and Boundaries","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ssrn.com/abstract=372280"},

  {"id":"cassPropertyRightsSystems","abstract":"Property rights - rights to control, use, or transfer things (broadly conceived) - though not readily distinguished from other rights, comprise a category of rights that both strongly benefit from clear and well-designed legal rules and often are subject to \"chiseling\" from failures to follow legal rules or from ex post alterations of the rules. Governance systems that limit official discretion to impair property rights, that have institutions and rules that provide clear definition to property rights and that provide predictable and consistent applications of those rights, will accord with the rule of law and generally will also advance social welfare. Some systems will depart quite evidently from this pattern, to the detriment of those societies, allowing too ready changes in law at the discretion of too few officials, too unconstrained by law, as the example of Zimbabwe illustrates. But differences between the good and the bad will not be drawn along simple, discrete lines, a point made by comparing the Zimbabwe example with the United States. The systems most consistent with the rule of law will not be able effectively to bar all changes in the law or to eliminate official discretion. Instead, those systems will limit the avenues for change and the ambit of discretion in ways that make property more secure and impositions on it more predictable without reference to the identity of the individual official enforcing the law or the individual property owners subject to it.","author":[{"family":"Cass","given":"Ronald A"}],"language":"en","page":"39","source":"Zotero","title":"Property rights systems and the rule of law","type":"article-journal"},

The Hybrid Media System is a sweeping new theory of how political communication now works. Politics is increasingly defined by organizations, groups, and individuals who are best able to blend older and newer media logics, in what Chadwick terms a hybrid system. From American presidential campaigns to WikiLeaks, from live prime ministerial debates to hotly contested political scandals, from the daily practices of journalists and campaign workers to the struggles of new activist organizations, the clash of media logics causes chaos and disintegration but also surprising new patterns of order and integration.

Using a meta-analysis, we estimated the mean effect size and tested whether the effect size was influenced by study characteristics. Data for this meta-analysis were derived from 56 papers reporting 63 independent studies. Results revealed that Internet use had a weak relationship with political participation (rc = .22). Moderator analyses demonstrated that type of Internet use, Internet use measure, Internet use for news, type of political participation, sample origin, and survey year significantly moderated the relationship between Internet use and political participation. For instance, Internet use including news (rc = .27) had a significantly stronger relationship with political participation than did Internet use excluding news (rc = .19). European samples (rc = .27) had the largest mean correlation followed by North American samples (rc = .23) and Asian samples (rc = .18) in decreasing order of strength of relationship.

Specifically, the authors posit that the effect of economic inequality on cross-national homicide rates is mediated by the perceived legitimacy of the system of stratification; that is, the effect of economic inequality on cross-national homicide rates should be substantially attenuated once perceived legitimacy is controlled. The authors test this hypothesis with data from 33 of the 44 nation-states that participated in the third wave of the World Values Survey. Negative binomial regression analyses reveal that perceptions of legitimacy do not mediate the effects of economic inequality on homicide. However, they do indicate that the impact of economic, and political, illegitimacy on homicide depends on the level of modernity. The implications of these findings for the economic inequality-homicide relationship are explored.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Chamlin","given":"Mitchell B."},{"family":"Cochran","given":"John K."}],"container-title":"Homicide Studies","container-title-short":"Homicide Studies","DOI":"10.1177/1088767906292642","ISSN":"1088-7679","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"231-252","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Economic Inequality, Legitimacy, and Cross-National Homicide Rates","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1088767906292642","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"chandProtectingAgencyJudges2019","abstract":"Administrative judges, who serve in state and federal agencies, as opposed to a separate branch of government, are an understudied, and occasionally controversial, type of public administrator. Many who find themselves in administrative courts protest the agency judge’s lack of independence. According to critics, because agency judges are members of—and often evaluated by—the very agency with a vested interest in the case, they are subject to political influence and cannot possibly be an impartial arbitrator. In the United States, various approaches to addressing this concern have been employed. At the federal level, Congress grants some administrative judges statutory protections from agency evaluation. Most states have utilized an organizational independence approach by placing administrative judges in separate agencies dedicated to administrative adjudications. Via a national survey returned by 250 agency judges, this study compares perceptions of judicial independence and decisional confidence. It finds that administrative judges serving in independent agencies (known as central panels) report higher levels of judicial independence and more confidence their rulings will not be overturned. The theoretical implications are significant for public administration and administrative law scholars, especially those concerned about the politicization of administrative duties.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Chand","given":"Daniel E."}],"container-title":"The American Review of Public Administration","container-title-short":"The American Review of Public Administration","DOI":"10.1177/0275074019829608","ISSN":"0275-0740","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"395-410","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Protecting Agency Judges in an Age of Politicization: Evaluating Judicial Independence and Decisional Confidence in Administrative Adjudications","title-short":"Protecting Agency Judges in an Age of Politicization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0275074019829608","volume":"49"},

An additional goal of this study was to examine how the public generally perceive police and how race and racism shape this discourse. To answer this secondary question, we examined narratives provided by 36 contributors to the NPMSRP site. The following two questions were foundational to this study: (1) What do findings from the NPMSRP suggest about the rate of police brutality in America? (2) How do individuals perceive the police department, and what implications do these perceptions hold for Black men in America? In general, fatalities at the hands of police are higher than they are for the general public. Grounded theory analysis of the data revealed that individuals perceive members of law enforcement in the following ways: (a) contempt for law enforcement, (b) suspicion of law enforcement, (c) law enforcement as agents of brutality, and (d) respect for law enforcement.

  {"id":"changTroubleHorizonForecasting2019","abstract":"Online discussions often derail into toxic exchanges between participants. Recent efforts mostly focused on detecting antisocial behavior after the fact, by analyzing single comments in isolation. To provide more timely notice to human moderators, a system needs to preemptively detect that a conversation is heading towards derailment before it actually turns toxic. This means modeling derailment as an emerging property of a conversation rather than as an isolated utterance-level event. Forecasting emerging conversational properties, however, poses several inherent modeling challenges. First, since conversations are dynamic, a forecasting model needs to capture the flow of the discussion, rather than properties of individual comments. Second, real conversations have an unknown horizon: they can end or derail at any time; thus a practical forecasting model needs to assess the risk in an online fashion, as the conversation develops. In this work we introduce a conversational forecasting model that learns an unsupervised representation of conversational dynamics and exploits it to predict future derailment as the conversation develops. By applying this model to two new diverse datasets of online conversations with labels for antisocial events, we show that it outperforms state-of-the-art systems at forecasting derailment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Chang","given":"Jonathan P."},{"family":"Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil","given":"Cristian"}],"container-title":"arXiv preprint arXiv:1909.01362","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,3]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Trouble on the Horizon: Forecasting the Derailment of Online Conversations as they Develop","title-short":"Trouble on the Horizon","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01362"},

From a survey of studies done on the rule of law in Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Americas, the review identiﬁes four general characteristics of this mode of inquiry, namely, that it is located, relational, and comparative and has extrinsic value. It offers three nonexhaustive reasons for interpreting the rule of law ethnographically, which are as a counterhegemonic practice, in response to counterintuitive observations, and as a means to do constitutive theorizing. Contending that ethnographic work on the rule of law involves some kind of stance toward both research subjects and object of inquiry, the review advocates for the exercise of passionate humility: a conviction about the rule of law tempered by willingness to be proven wrong through inquiries in critical proximity with socially and politically mediated facts. Rule-of-law ethnography’s possibility lies in its attending to the relationship between what is claimed in the rule of law’s name and what is realized, not to make the idea look foolish, but to show how it emerges and why it persists through struggle.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Cheesman","given":"Nick"}],"container-title":"Annual Review of Law and Social Science","DOI":"10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-101317-030900","ISSN":"1550-3585, 1550-3631","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,10,13]]},"language":"en","page":"167-184","source":"Crossref","title":"Rule-of-Law Ethnography","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-101317-030900","volume":"14"},

Our results yield several insights, including that article text can be used to classify political affiliation with high accuracy, and that left-leaning sites focus on specific fake news stories and individuals involved, while right-leaning sites shift the focus to a narrative of mainstream media dishonesty more broadly.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Che","given":"Xunru"},{"family":"Metaxa-Kakavouli","given":"Danaë"},{"family":"Hancock","given":"Jeffrey T."}],"collection-title":"CSCW '18","container-title":"Companion of the 2018 ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing","DOI":"10.1145/3272973.3274079","event-place":"Jersey City, NJ, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-6018-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,10,30]]},"page":"289–292","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"Jersey City, NJ, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Fake News in the News: An Analysis of Partisan Coverage of the Fake News Phenomenon","title-short":"Fake News in the News","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://doi.org/10.1145/3272973.3274079"},

  {"id":"cheney-lippoldWeAreData2017","abstract":"What identity means in an algorithmic age: how it works, how our lives are controlled by it, and how we can resist it  Algorithms are everywhere, organizing the near limitless data that exists in our world. Derived from our every search, like, click, and purchase, algorithms determine the news we get, the ads we see, the information accessible to us and even who our friends are. These complex configurations not only form knowledge and social relationships in the digital and physical world, but also determine who we are and who we can be, both on and offline.  Algorithms create and recreate us, using our data to assign and reassign our gender, race, sexuality, and citizenship status. They can recognize us as celebrities or mark us as terrorists. In this era of ubiquitous surveillance, contemporary data collection entails more than gathering information about us. Entities like Google, Facebook, and the NSA also decide what that information means, constructing our worlds and the identities we inhabit in the process. We have little control over who we algorithmically are. Our identities are made useful not for us-but for someone else.  Through a series of entertaining and engaging examples, John Cheney-Lippold draws on the social constructions of identity to advance a new understanding of our algorithmic identities. We Are Data will educate and inspire readers who want to wrest back some freedom in our increasingly surveilled and algorithmically-constructed world.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,20]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Cheney-Lippold","given":"John"}],"DOI":"10.2307/j.ctt1gk0941","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-1-4798-5759-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"number-of-pages":"320","publisher":"NYU Press","publisher-place":"New York","source":"JSTOR","title":"We Are Data: Algorithms and The Making of Our Digital Selves","title-short":"We Are Data","type":"book","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gk0941"},

  {"id":"chenRuleTrustPower2018","abstract":"Emerging as a comprehensive and aggressive governance scheme in China, the “Social Credit System” (SCS) seeks to promote the norms of “trust” in the Chinese society by rewarding behavior that is considered “trust-keeping” and punishing those considered “trust-breaking.” This Article closely examines the evolving SCS regime and corrects myths and misunderstandings popularized in the international media. We identify four key mechanisms of the SCS, i.e., information gathering, information sharing, labeling, and joint sanctions, and highlight their unique characteristics as well as normative implications. In our view, the new governance mode underlying the SCS—what we call the “rule of trust”—relies on the fuzzy notion of “trust” and wide-ranging arbitrary and disproportionate punishments. It derogates from the notion of “governing the country in accordance with the law” enshrined in China’s Constitution.\nThis Article contributes to legal scholarship by offering a distinctive critique of the perils of China’s SCS in terms of the party-state’s tightening social control and human rights violations. Further, we critically assess how the Chinese government uses information and communication technologies to facilitate data-gathering and data-sharing in the SCS with few meaningful legal constraints. The unbounded and uncertain notion of “trust” and the unrestrained employment of technology are a dangerous combination in the context of governance. We conclude with a caution that with considerable sophistication, the Chinese government is preparing a much more sweeping version of SCS reinforced by artificial intelligence tools such as facial-recognition and predictive policing. Those developments will further empower the government to enhance surveillance and perpetuate authoritarianism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Yu-Jie"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Ching-Fu"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Han-Wei"}],"container-title":"Columbia Journal of Asian Law","ISSN":"2373-0498","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1-36","source":"journals.library.columbia.edu","title":"“Rule of Trust”: The Power and Perils of China’s Social Credit Megaproject","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.library.columbia.edu/index.php/cjal/article/view/3369","volume":"32"},
  {"id":"chenStudentEvaluationTeaching2003","abstract":"Over the past century, student ratings have steadily continued to take precedence in faculty evaluation systems in North America and Australia, are increasingly reported in Asia and Europe and are attracting considerable attention in the Far East. Since student ratings are the most, if not the only, influential measure of teaching effectiveness, active participation by and meaningful input from students can be critical in the success of such teaching evaluation systems. Nevertheless, very few studies have looked into students' perception of the teaching evaluation system and their motivation to participate. This study employs expectancy theory to evaluate some key factors that motivate students to participate in the teaching evaluation process. The results show that students generally consider an improvement in teaching to be the most attractive outcome of a teaching evaluation system. The second most attractive outcome was using teaching evaluations to improve course content and format. Using teaching evaluations for a professor's tenure, promotion and salary rise decisions and making the results of evaluations available for students' decisions on course and instructor selection were less important from the students' standpoint. Students' motivation to participate in teaching evaluations is also impacted significantly by their expectation that they will be able to provide meaningful feedback. Since quality student input is an essential antecedent of meaningful student evaluations of teaching effectiveness, the results of this study should be considered thoughtfully as the evaluation system is designed, implemented and operated.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"CHEN","given":"YINING"},{"family":"HOSHOWER","given":"LEON B."}],"container-title":"Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education","DOI":"10.1080/02602930301683","ISSN":"0260-2938","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,1,1]]},"page":"71-88","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Student Evaluation of Teaching Effectiveness: An assessment of student perception and motivation","title-short":"Student Evaluation of Teaching Effectiveness","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/02602930301683","volume":"28"},

Currently, it is unclear what factors prompt regular social media users with no malicious intent to forward misinformation to their online networks. Using a questionnaire informed by the Uses and Gratifications theory and the literature on rumor research, this study asked university students in Singapore why they shared misinformation on social media. Gender differences were also tested. The study found that perceived information characteristics such as its ability to spark conversations and its catchiness were top factors. Self-expression and socializing motivations were also among the top reasons. Women reported a higher prevalence of misinformation sharing.

  {"id":"chesneyStateSecretsLimits2007","abstract":"The state secretsprivilege has played a centralrole in the Justice Department's response to civil litigation arising out of post-9/11 counterterrorismpolicies, culminating in a controversial decision by Judge T.S. Ellis concerning a lawsuit brought by a German citizen-Khaled EI-Masri-whom the United States allegedly had rendered (by mistake) from Macedonia to Afghanistan for interrogation. Reasoning that the \"entire aim of the suit is to prove the existence of state secrets,\" Judge Ellis held that the complaint had to be dismissed in light of the privilege. The government also has interposedthe privilege in connection with litigation arising out of the National Security Agency's warrantless surveillanceprogram, albeit with mixed success so far. These events amply demonstrate the significance of the state secrets privilege, but unfortunately much uncertainty remains regardingits parametersand justifications. Is it being used by the Bush administrationin cases like E1-Masri v. Tenet, as some critics have suggested, in a manner that breaks with past practice,either in qualitative or quantitative terms? I address these questions through a survey of the origin and evolution of the privilege, compiling along the way a comprehensive collection of state secrets decisions issued in published opinions since the Supreme Court's seminal 1953 decisionin United States v. Reynolds (the collection appearsin the article's appendix). Based on the survey, I find that the Bush administrationdoes not differ qualitativelyfrom its predecessorsin its use of the privilege, which since the early 1970s has frequently been the occasion for abrupt dismissal of lawsuits alleging government misconduct. I also conclude that the quantitative inquiry serves little purpose in light of variation in the number of occasions for potential invocation of the privilege from year to year.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Chesney","given":"Robert M."}],"container-title":"George Washington Law Review","container-title-short":"Geo.

  {"id":"chinInternetGovernanceChina2019","abstract":"The advent of the Internet and social media has decentralised authority over networking, and national government faces not only the challenge of the vast volume of communication flows but also the increasing decision-making and governance power over the Internet by private companies and civil society organizations, which constitute a new locus of authority. How has national government engaged with those non-state actors in Internet governance? This chapter incorporates the network governance approach in examining the patterns of private-state-civil collaboration in governance of the Internet in China.  Network governance approach is characterised by its encouragement of consultation and coordination as a way of pre-empting conflicts or to solve problems and of binding unofficial and organic social actors together not through legal procedures but social ties. Analytically, this chapter treats the “The Beijing District Joint Anti Online Rumor Platform (BJARP)” governance network as the unit of analysis and as a positive mechanism of coordination in response to societal and technological progress and to failures of market, and failure of hierarchical coordination in refuting rumours. It concludes that in order to have a better and impartial understanding of the complex relationships between the state and society in Internet governance in contemporary China, researchers not only need to examine the roles of state and party and their policies and regulations, but also need to conduct empirical researches about the roles of social organisations and private actors in the processes of governance and policy-making.  This chapter has made significant efforts in filling up this gap and contributing to a better understanding of Internet governance in China with its empirical research and critical analysis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Chin","given":"Yik Chan"}],"event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,5]]},"language":"en","number":"ID 3310921","publisher":"Social Science Research Network","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"papers.ssrn.com","title":"Internet Governance in China: The Network Governance Approach","title-short":"Internet Governance in China","type":"report","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3310921"},

However, this expansion comes with great difficulties in adequately identifying and responding to everyone’s needs. In this paper, we study gender-related behaviors of guests on the currently most prominent home-sharing platform, Airbnb. While our results confirm the efficacy of Airbnb’s reputation system, we also find that the level of trust and participation on the platform varies by gender. In particular, female solo travelers are more likely to be conscious of review sentiment and choose more often female hosts than male solo travelers. Our findings are obtained by combining exploratory data analysis with large-scale experiments and call for further studies on the usage of sharing economy platforms among subpopulations, informing and improving both policy and practice in these growing online environments.","author":[{"family":"Choi","given":"Eunseo"},{"family":"Horvát","given":"Emőke-Ágnes"}],"collection-title":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science","container-title":"Social Informatics","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-34971-4_1","editor":[{"family":"Weber","given":"Ingmar"},{"family":"Darwish","given":"Kareem M."},{"family":"Wagner","given":"Claudia"},{"family":"Zagheni","given":"Emilio"},{"family":"Nelson","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Aref","given":"Samin"},{"family":"Flöck","given":"Fabian"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-030-34971-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"3-17","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Springer Link","title":"Airbnb’s Reputation System and Gender Differences Among Guests: Evidence from Large-Scale Data Analysis and a Controlled Experiment","title-short":"Airbnb’s Reputation System and Gender Differences Among Guests","type":"paper-conference"},

I will argue that these attempts at inclusion create constitutional irresolutions either forcing impossible demands on constitutionalism or dispelling the disorganisation it is meant to give expression to. I will then argue that in spite of the inability to capture them as constitutional moments, politics of ‘pure presence’ and real self-determination are possible, and against constitutional mystifications, resistance might find its opportunity in praxis, understood in the language of praxis philosophy (more specifically the work of Antonio Negri).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Christodoulidis","given":"Emilios"}],"container-title":"European Law Journal","DOI":"10.1111/1468-0386.00184","ISSN":"1468-0386","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"401-432","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Constitutional Irresolution: Law and the Framing of Civil Society","title-short":"Constitutional Irresolution","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1468-0386.00184","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"christopherFailureInternalAudit2018","abstract":"Within the management and organization field, the internal audit function (IAF) plays an important role in enhancing good governance. Given the spate of corporate collapses over the last 20 years, this article draws on a multitheoretical approach to governance and a critical review of the published literature to identify where IAFs have failed, and to provide a new focus to strengthen their role. Common themes regarding monitoring gaps by IAFs were identified as occurring across three governance levels. A contributory cause for these gaps is the poor structural and functional arrangements of the IAF, arising from the considerable flexibility afforded in its setup and delivery of services. A negative consequence of this flexibility is the ability of the board and management to manipulate the role of the IAF to the extent that it is not aligned with the intention of its setup as encapsulated in its definition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Christopher","given":"Joe"}],"container-title":"Journal of Management Inquiry","DOI":"10.1177/1056492618774852","ISSN":"1056-4926, 1552-6542","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,21]]},"language":"en","page":"105649261877485","source":"Crossref","title":"The Failure of Internal Audit: Monitoring Gaps and a Case for a New Focus","title-short":"The Failure of Internal Audit","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1056492618774852"},

  {"id":"cirucciRedefiningPrivacyAnonymity2015","abstract":"Social networking sites allow people to create, broadcast, and interpret the self in new and evolving ways. While early online social media studies praised the Internet for providing an anonymous space in which to experiment with identity, more recent research suggests that social networking sites have become not anonymous, as they compel users to perform identity in new ways. Through a novel application of affordance theory, this paper argues that instead of attempting to apply outdated definitions of privacy to social networking spaces, we should instead be discussing our right to anonymity. I argue that privacy is immaterial due to the fact that from the moment we log in and interact with a social media interface, we have shared some type of personal information with someone. Anonymity, on the other hand, is defined as the unlinkability of our many identifications. Thus, instead of attempting to define ideas such as “personal” and “private,” we should instead fight for the separation of selves, both at the social and institutional level.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Cirucci","given":"Angela M."}],"container-title":"First Monday","DOI":"10.5210/fm.v20i7.5465","ISSN":"13960466","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,6,26]]},"language":"en","source":"journals.uic.edu","title":"Redefining privacy and anonymity through social networking affordances","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/5465","volume":"20"},

  {"id":"citronHateCrimesCyberspace2014","abstract":"Most Internet users are familiar with trolling—aggressive, foul-mouthed posts designed to elicit angry responses in a site's comments. Less familiar but far more serious is the way some use networked technologies to target real people, subjecting them, by name and address, to vicious, often terrifying, online abuse. In an in-depth investigation of a problem that is too often trivialized by lawmakers and the media, Danielle Keats Citronexposes the startling extent of personal cyber-attacks and proposes practical, lawful ways to prevent and punish online harassment. A refutation of those who claim that these attacks are legal, or at least impossible to stop,Hate Crimes in Cyberspace reveals the serious emotional, professional, and financial harms incurred by victims.Persistent online attacks disproportionately target women and frequently include detailed fantasies of rape as well as reputation-ruining lies and sexually explicit photographs. And if dealing with a single attacker's “revenge porn” were not enough, harassing posts that make their way onto social media sites often feed on one another, turning lone instigators into cyber-mobs.Hate Crimes in Cyberspace rejects the view of the Internet as an anarchic Wild West, where those who venture online must be thick-skinned enough to endure all manner of verbal assault in the name of free speech protection, no matter how distasteful or abusive. Cyber-harassment is a matter of civil rights law, Citron contends, and legal precedents as well as social norms of decency and civility must be leveraged to stop it.","author":[{"family":"Citron","given":"Danielle Keats"}],"ISBN":"978-0-674-36829-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,9,22]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"352","publisher":"Harvard University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Hate Crimes in Cyberspace","type":"book"},

However, conflicting theoretical and empirical findings have given rise to a significant discrepancy in the scholarship. Building on evidence from interviews with Supreme Court justices and former law clerks, I develop a formal model of judicial-congressional relations that incorporates judicial preferences for institutional legitimacy and the role of public opinion in congressional hostility towards the Supreme Court. An original dataset identifying all Court-curbing legislation proposed between 1877 and 2006 is then used to assess the influence of congressional hostility on the Court's use of judicial review. The evidence indicates that public discontent with the Court, as mediated through congressional hostility, creates an incentive for the Court to exercise self-restraint. When Congress is hostile, the Court uses judicial review to invalidate Acts of Congress less frequently than when Congress is not hostile towards the Court.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,10]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Clark","given":"Tom S."}],"container-title":"American Journal of Political Science","ISSN":"0092-5853","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"page":"971-989","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Separation of Powers, Court Curbing, and Judicial Legitimacy","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/20647961","volume":"53"},

Then, in the body of the article, the author provides an overview of the struggle in environmental sociology to find connections between urbanization and the natural environment. The main focus is on how environmental sociologists have theorized the environmental impact of urbanization, although other relevant topics (e.g., environmental justice in the city) are briefly addressed. Through the course of the article, several principles are developed to help guide a future environmental sociology of urbanization.

  {"id":"cliffordHowEmotionalFrames2019","abstract":"Moralized issues, such as abortion and same-sex marriage, are some of the most polarizing and divisive issues in politics. These topics motivate political engagement but present a barrier to democratic resolution. Yet we know little about how some issues become “moral issues” and others do not. In this article, I argue that exposure to persuasive frames, particularly those eliciting anger and disgust, serves to moralize and polarize public opinion. I test these hypotheses across three experiments on emerging debates over food politics. The results consistently show that persuasive frames increase issue moralization and, in turn, facilitate polarization. A panel analysis demonstrates that the effect of a single exposure lasts at least two weeks. Mediation analyses suggest that feelings of disgust and anger help explain how persuasive frames moralize political attitudes, while anger alone seems to explain the polarizing effects of framing. Overall, the findings provide new insight into framing, emotion, and the development of moral issues.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Clifford","given":"Scott"}],"container-title":"Political Psychology","DOI":"10.1111/pops.12507","ISSN":"1467-9221","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"75-91","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"How Emotional Frames Moralize and Polarize Political Attitudes","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/pops.12507","volume":"40"},
  {"id":"clureRousseauDiderotSpirit2015","abstract":"SummaryIn the Social Contract, Rousseau predicted that Europe would experience a cycle of increasingly intense wars, culminating in invasion from the east: ﬁrst, Russia would conquer Europe's exhausted and war-torn states; then, Russia would itself become overextended and Europe would ultimately be overrun by the Tartars. The future of the modern state would be a version of the fall of Rome. The present essay provides an explanation of why Rousseau held such apocalyptic views by placing them in the context of projects to reform Europe's political economy in the aftermath of the Seven Years’ War. In 1767, when Catherine the Great was planning a major revision of the Russian legal code, she outlined her goals in a manifesto called the Grand Instruction, key sections of which were derived from Montesquieu's analysis of depopulation of the countryside caused by uncontrolled industrialisation. The Grand Instruction became the subject of a critical exchange between the Physiocrat Le Trosne and Diderot, who, drawing upon Rousseau, was by turns both sympathetic to and sceptical of Physiocracy. This discourse reveals a triangular debate about the possibility of stabilising the international order by imposing a balance between the agricultural and manufacturing sectors of Europe's rapidly growing economies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Clure","given":"Graham"}],"container-title":"History of European Ideas","DOI":"10.1080/01916599.2015.1029728","ISSN":"0191-6599, 1873-541X","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,10,3]]},"language":"en","page":"883-908","source":"Crossref","title":"Rousseau, Diderot and the Spirit of Catherine the Great's Reforms","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01916599.2015.1029728","volume":"41"},

  {"id":"cochePrivatisedEnforcementRight2018","abstract":"The purpose of this paper is to explore the risks of privatised enforcement in the field of terrorism propaganda, stemming from the EU Code of conduct on countering illegal hate speech online. By shedding light on this Code, the author argues that implementation of it may undermine the rule of law and give rise to private censorship. In order to outweigh these risks, IT companies should improve their transparency, especially towards users whose content have been affected. Where automated means are used, the companies should always have in place some form of human intervention in order to contextualise posts. At the EU level, the Commission should provide IT companies with clearer guidelines regarding their liability exemption under the e-Commerce Directive. This would help prevent a race-to-the bottom where intermediaries choose to interpret and apply the most stringent national laws in order to secure at utmost their liability. The paper further articulates on the fine line that exists between ‘terrorist content’ and ‘illegal hate speech’ and the need for more detailed definitions.","author":[{"family":"Coche","given":"Eugénie"}],"issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","page":"17","source":"Zotero","title":"Privatised enforcement and the right to freedom of expression in a world confronted with terrorism propaganda online","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"cohenMeaningsViolence1998","abstract":"Cultures vary tremendously in how they understand violence. We discuss white southern and northern culture in the United States to illustrate the different meanings cultures ascribe to violence and honor. We argue that (1) Southerners understand the meaning of insults differently than Northerners do. (2) They have behavioral rituals that make allowances for this understanding. And (3) they live within social structures and systems that perpetuate these “culture‐of‐honor” meanings and ideologies. Laboratory experiments, field experiments, surveys, analyses of laws, and records of homicide rates are reviewed. Also, we discuss the legacy of slavery, which legitimized forms of coercive and punitive violence over and above violence legitimized by a culture of honor. Southern violence cannot be understood simply as deviance and lawlessness. Rather, it is a product of a coherent meaning system defining the self, honor, rituals for conflict, and tools that may be used when order is disrupted.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Cohen","given":"Dov"},{"family":"Vandello","given":"Joe"}],"container-title":"The Journal of Legal Studies","container-title-short":"The Journal of Legal Studies","DOI":"10.1086/468035","ISSN":"0047-2530","issue":"S2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1998,6,1]]},"page":"567-584","publisher":"The University of Chicago Press","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"Meanings of Violence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/468035","volume":"27"},

  {"id":"cohenReflectionsHabermasDemocracy1999","abstract":"Jürgen Habermas is a radical democrat. The source of that self-designation is that his conception of democracy—what he calls “discursive democracy”—is founded on the ideal of “a self-organizing community of free and equal citizens,” coordinating their collective affairs through their common reason. The author discusses three large challenges to this radical-democratic ideal of collective self-regulation: 1) What is the role of private autonomy in a radical-democratic view? 2) What role does reason play in collective self-regulation? 3) What relevance might a radical-democratic outlook have for contemporary democracies? The author addresses these questions by considering Habermas' answers, and then presenting alternative responses to them. The alternatives are also radical-democratic in inspiration, but they draw on a richer set of normative-political ideas than Habermas wants to rely on, and are more ambitious in their hopes for democratic practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Cohen","given":"Joshua"}],"container-title":"Ratio Juris","DOI":"10.1111/1467-9337.00132","ISSN":"1467-9337","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[1999,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"385-416","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Reflections on Habermas on Democracy","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1467-9337.00132","volume":"12"},

While large effect sizes were also found for more specific rating dimensions such as Skill and Structure, other dimensions showed more modest relationships with student achievement.

  {"id":"cohenWhenJudgesHave2015","abstract":"Influential theories of law have celebrated judicial reasongiving as furtheringa host of democratic values, includingjudges' accountability,citizens'participationin adjudication,and a more accurate and transparent decision-making process. This Article has two main purposes. First, it argues that although reasongiving is important, it is often in tension with other values of the judicial process, such as guidance, sincerity, and efficiency. Reason-giving must, therefore, be balanced against these competing values. In other words, judges sometimes have reasons not to give reasons. Second, contrary to common intuition, common law and civil law systems deal with this tension between reasons for and against reason-giving in increasingly similar ways. By combining theories of democratic legitimacy with empirical, doctrinal, and historical evidence of judges' concrete reason-giving practices in the United States and Europe, the Article argues that rather than being in opposition, these two legal cultures are converging toward a common methodology. No longer can it be assumed that civil law judges and common law judges are on opposite ends of the spectrum.","author":[{"family":"Cohen","given":"Mathilde"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"language":"en","page":"90","source":"Zotero","title":"When Judges Have Reasons Not to Give Reasons: A Comparative Law Approach","type":"article-journal"},

To remain effective over time, institutions need to adapt to changes in the environment or the society the institution is meant to regulate.

This essay contributes to a theory of adaptive efﬁciency by relating it to the burgeoning literature in robust system design. It reviews ﬁve models of institutional change, paying particular attention to each model’s ability to explain institutional adaptation. It isolates three common structural features of a robust, adaptive institutional system: diversity, modularity, and redundancy. It illustrates the theory with a brief application to federal systems, and closes by describing some open research questions relating to institutional adaptive efﬁciency.","ISBN":"978-0-262-03538-5 978-0-262-33771-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,8,19]]},"language":"en","publisher":"The MIT Press","source":"Crossref","title":"Complexity and Evolution","type":"book"},

  {"id":"connollyNecessityKnowsNo2017","abstract":"The doctrine of Kriegsraison, and its argument that ‘necessity knows no law’, is generally considered to have been laid to rest with the creation of the 1949 Geneva Conventions. However, this article asserts that Kriegsraison is resurrected and wholly alive in the USAs’ targeted killing programme. The targeted killing programme, now in existence for more than 15 years, remains one of the most problematic aspects of US anti-terror policy and continues to raise numerous legal questions. The article argues that treatment of the various legal frameworks relevant to targeted killing by the USA is suffused with Kriegsraison to such an extent that necessity, in its varying iterations, has become the primary guiding principle for US uses of force, and assessments as to their legality. This argument is predicated on an examination of the USAs’ expansive interpretation of jus ad bellum principles, its a-la-carte approach in recognising the applicability of jus in bello rules, and the designation of regions in which it uses force as lying ‘outside the area of active hostilities’. Throughout this assessment, parallels are drawn between the conduct of the USA today and between that of WWI-era Germany, which was characterised by Kriegsraison’s pervasive inﬂuence. Finally, the article contends that the use of armed drones as the primary tool for carrying out the targeted killing programme must be scrutinised, as this is vital to understanding the practical implementation of the Kriegsraison doctrine.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Connolly","given":"Catherine"}],"container-title":"Journal of Conflict and Security Law","DOI":"10.1093/jcsl/krx017","ISSN":"1467-7954, 1467-7962","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"463-496","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"‘Necessity Knows no Law’: The Resurrection of Kriegsraison through the US Targeted Killing Programme","title-short":"‘Necessity Knows no Law’","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://academic.oup.com/jcsl/article/22/3/463/4727625","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"constantinidesInformationInfrastructureDevelopment2014","abstract":"In this paper, we examine the challenges around the development and scalability of information infrastructures. We identify two possible solutions proposed in the literature, one emphasizing more top-down control and the need for a clear IT governance framework, and a second arguing for a more flexible approach since absolute control is impossible and only leads to drift and unintended outcomes. We suggest that there is a clear gap in the literature in better understanding how to govern the development of information infrastructures using a bottom-up approach. We build on research that approaches IS development as a collective action problem and focus on how different actors frame the infrastructure as a public and private good, and how the framing process is underpinned by actors’ different ideologies. We use our theoretical approach to examine the framing of the development of a regional health information infrastructure in Crete. Our analysis examines how different actors frame the infrastructure as a collective action good and explore their ideological positioning. We explore the struggle around meanings attributed to the good over time as being a public or private one in establishing or sustaining relations of power, and how legitimacy is challenged or reinforced. Finally, we develop contributions on the collective action challenges in infrastructure development and suggest how a polycentric approach to governance might be further developed to promote the ongoing cultivation of information infrastructures from the bottom up.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Constantinides","given":"Panos"},{"family":"Barrett","given":"Michael"}],"container-title":"Information Systems Research","container-title-short":"Information Systems Research","DOI":"10.1287/isre.2014.0542","ISSN":"1047-7047","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,11,17]]},"page":"40-56","publisher":"INFORMS","source":"pubsonline-informs-org.proxy.lib.uiowa.edu (Atypon)","title":"Information Infrastructure Development and Governance as Collective Action","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/isre.2014.0542","volume":"26"},

The major emphasis of the analysis is the so-called Islamic State (IS) and disruption of their online activity, but a catchall “Other Jihadi” category is also utilized for comparison purposes. Our findings challenge the notion that Twitter remains a conducive space for pro-IS accounts and communities to flourish. However, not all jihadists on Twitter are subject to the same high levels of disruption as IS, and we show that there is differential disruption taking place. IS’s and other jihadists’ online activity was never solely restricted to Twitter; it is just one node in a wider jihadist social media ecology.

  {"id":"corbett-daviesMeasureMismeasureFairness2018","abstract":"The nascent field of fair machine learning aims to ensure that decisions guided by algorithms are equitable. Over the last several years, three formal definitions of fairness have gained prominence: (1) anti-classification, meaning that protected attributes---like race, gender, and their proxies---are not explicitly used to make decisions; (2) classification parity, meaning that common measures of predictive performance (e.g., false positive and false negative rates) are equal across groups defined by the protected attributes; and (3) calibration, meaning that conditional on risk estimates, outcomes are independent of protected attributes. Here we show that all three of these fairness definitions suffer from significant statistical limitations. Requiring anti-classification or classification parity can, perversely, harm the very groups they were designed to protect; and calibration, though generally desirable, provides little guarantee that decisions are equitable. In contrast to these formal fairness criteria, we argue that it is often preferable to treat similarly risky people similarly, based on the most statistically accurate estimates of risk that one can produce. Such a strategy, while not universally applicable, often aligns well with policy objectives; notably, this strategy will typically violate both anti-classification and classification parity. In practice, it requires significant effort to construct suitable risk estimates. One must carefully define and measure the targets of prediction to avoid retrenching biases in the data. But, importantly, one cannot generally address these difficulties by requiring that algorithms satisfy popular mathematical formalizations of fairness. By highlighting these challenges in the foundation of fair machine learning, we hope to help researchers and practitioners productively advance the area.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Corbett-Davies","given":"Sam"},{"family":"Goel","given":"Sharad"}],"container-title":"arXiv:1808.00023 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,31]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"The Measure and Mismeasure of Fairness: A Critical Review of Fair Machine Learning","title-short":"The Measure and Mismeasure of Fairness","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00023"},

  {"id":"couldryMythUsDigital2015","abstract":"This article examines critically the claims that digital networks (digital media infrastructures, especially social media platforms) fundamentally change the conditions of politics over the longer term. Without doubt digital networks enable faster political mobilization, accelerated cycles of action, and some new forms of collectivity, but how consequential is this in the longer term when set alongside other longer term consequences of a digitally saturated environment? The author argues that some leading accounts of digital media's contributions to political change operate with a thin account of the social, the sort of thin account that historically has been supplemented by media's mythical accounts over the past century of their role in supplying social knowledge. In the digital age, even the most detailed and rigorous accounts of digital networks' contributions to political action (Bennett & Segerberg, 2012, 2013) fail to show that those networks also facilitate longer term political action that builds longer term political transformations: arguably, the resulting acceleration of action encourages short-term loyalties and less stability in political socialization. However, this limitation of existing accounts tends to be masked by a new myth for the age of digital networks: the myth of ‘us’, which encourages us to believe that our gatherings on social media platforms are a natural form of expressive collectivity, even though it is exactly that belief that is at the basis of such platforms' creation of economic value. The article deconstructs that myth, as the starting point for more satisfactory future accounts of digital networks' possible contributions to political change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Couldry","given":"Nick"}],"container-title":"Information, Communication & Society","DOI":"10.1080/1369118X.2014.979216","ISSN":"1369-118X","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,6,3]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2014.979216","page":"608-626","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The myth of ‘us’: digital networks, political change and the production of collectivity","title-short":"The myth of ‘us’","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2014.979216","volume":"18"},

The article discusses the different ways in which spontaneity and flexibility work under different kinds of planning conditions (being material, like buildings, open spaces or infrastructures, or immaterial, like building codes or land-use plans).

  {"id":"craneHumanLawHigher2009","abstract":"In setting the standards for what is or is not appropriate behavior, parents and children frequently confront an important distinction in the quality and nature of rulemaking. Certain acts are prohibited or required simply because the rulemaker decides it must be so and has the power to insist on obedience. When the child asks, “Why must I make my bed before breakfast?” the parent replies, “Because I say so.” Other rules, however, seem weightier or more profound. Prohibitions on bullying other children or teasing one’s pet often come with a conversation about values, such as kindness, reverence for life, or the golden rule.Applying this commonplace distinction to the workings of a legal system often leads to confusion. In his famous essay, “The Path of the Law,” Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. cautions us not to mistake law for morality. To understand the law, Holmes argues, “you must look at it as a bad man, who cares only for the material consequences which such knowledge enables him to predict, not as a good one, who finds his reasons for conduct, whether inside the law or outside of it, in the vaguer sanctions of conscience.” Like the child responding to a command that carries no more profound justification than the will of the parental lawmaker, the “bad man” studies the law in order to predict what kinds of actions will get him into trouble (regardless of whether he finds such acts morally reprehensible or not). In Holmes’s view, the language of law can sound like the language of morality, but one only has to recollect that “many laws … enforced in the past” and “enforced now … are condemned by the most enlightened opinion of the time” to see the necessity for distinguishing between legal and moral discourses.","archive":"Cambridge Core","author":[{"family":"Crane","given":"Gregg"}],"collection-title":"Cambridge Companions to Literature","container-title":"The Cambridge Companion to Frederick Douglass","DOI":"10.1017/CCOL9780521889230.007","editor":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Maurice S."}],"event-place":"Cambridge","ISBN":"978-0-521-88923-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"page":"89-102","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Human Law and Higher Law","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-companion-to-frederick-douglass/human-law-and-higher-law/BE30ADACD09F3D1B22E3402CCC6CCEFC"},

It serves both as a solution to the problem of curating massive collections of user-generated content and as a rhetorical justification for platform owners when they decide to remove content. Flags are becoming a ubiquitous mechanism of governance—yet their meaning is anything but straightforward. In practice, the interactions between users, flags, algorithms, content moderators, and platforms are complex and highly strategic. Significantly, flags are asked to bear a great deal of weight, arbitrating both the relationship between users and platforms, and the negotiation around contentious public issues. In this essay, we unpack the working of the flag, consider alternatives that give greater emphasis to public deliberation, and consider the implications for online public discourse of this now commonplace yet rarely studied sociotechnical mechanism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Crawford","given":"Kate"},{"family":"Gillespie","given":"Tarleton"}],"container-title":"New Media & Society","container-title-short":"New Media & Society","DOI":"10.1177/1461444814543163","ISSN":"1461-4448","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"410-428","publisher":"SAGE Publications","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"What is a flag for?

  {"id":"crespoHiddenLawPlea2018","abstract":"The American criminal justice system is a system of pleas. Few who know it well think it is working. And yet, identifying plausible strategies for law reform proves challenging, given the widely held scholarly assumption that plea bargaining operates “beyond the shadow of the law.” That assumption holds true with respect to substantive and constitutional criminal law—the two most studied bodies of law in the criminal justice system—neither of which significantly regulates prosecutorial power. The assumption is misguided, however, insofar as it fails to account for a third body of law—the subconstitutional law of criminal procedure—that regulates and often establishes the very mechanisms by which prosecutorial plea bargaining power is both generated and deployed. These hidden regulatory levers are neither theoretical nor abstract. Rather, they exist in strikingly varied forms across our pluralist criminal justice system. This Article excavates these unexamined legal frameworks, conceptualizes their regulatory potential, highlights their heterogeneity across jurisdictions, and exposes the institutional actors most frequently responsible for their content. In so doing, it opens up not only new scholarly terrain but also new potential pathways to criminal justice reform.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,20]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Crespo","given":"Andrew Manuel"}],"container-title":"Columbia Law Review","ISSN":"0010-1958","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"page":"1303-1424","publisher":"Columbia Law Review Association, Inc.","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Hidden Law of Plea Bargaining","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/26434609","volume":"118"},

After showing how all the building blocks of algorithmic regulation are already well in place, we discuss the possible implications for human autonomy and social order.

States, technology companies and civil society groups have established monitoring practices and solutions to address these concerns, which have assumed an international dimension. Taken as a whole, however, such efforts remain scattered and fragmented. The present article seeks to take stock of this complex system by adopting a polycentric governance approach. This approach contrasts with a state-centric vision to the degree that it favors establishing networks among centers for regulating global problems at several levels. The present article draws on a detailed cartography of the various measures that have been taken to regulate jihadist content. In addition to demonstrating the pluricentric and heterogenous nature of these measures, we present them as an “agonistic” system in which relations are simultaneously marked by conflict and mutual awareness. Yet conflict does not preclude action: over time, polycentric authority structures have given rise to a new architecture and new norms intended to facilitate control of information flows.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Crosset","given":"Valentine"},{"family":"Dupont","given":"Benoît"}],"container-title":"Critique internationale","ISSN":"1290-7839","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,14]]},"language":"fr","page":"107-125","publisher":"Presses de Sciences Po","source":"www.cairn-int.info","title":"The Internet and Jihadist Propaganda: The Polycentric Regulation of Cyberspace","title-short":"The Internet and Jihadist Propaganda","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cairn-int.info/article-E_CRII_078_0107--the-internet-and-jihadist-propaganda.htm","volume":"No 78"},

US research indicates that more than 90 percent of academic accounting departments use this performance measurement. This paper aims to focus on the validity of SET data. Design/methodology/approach: A mail survey was sent to a random sample of 1,000 accounting professors employed at four-year universities and colleges in the USA. A total of 447 responses were returned for a response rate of 44.7 percent. Statistical results of the survey for data are reported. Findings: Instructors engage in impression management when SET data are used for control purposes. Dysfunctional behavior of accounting instructors includes easy grading, inflating grades, course work deflation, and other defensive strategies which result in negative social implications. A significant 53 percent of the accounting instructors knew of other professors who have reduced grading standards and course content in order to improve SET scores. Practical implications: Universities worldwide risk legal action when they defame faculty members by releasing unreliable and invalid SET results. Originality/value: The paper illustrates some of the present problems with SET questionnaires.

  {"id":"crustoRightLifeInterestConvergence2018","abstract":"In the United States, police officers fatally shoot over one thousand people every year. A surprising few of these incidents are fully investigated. In fact, very few police officers are criminally prosecuted for, and are rarely found guilty of, homicide resulting from the unjustified use of lethal force. This Article contends that the lack of criminal prosecutions results mainly from leading United States Supreme Court decisions that establish the criminal liability standard for police use of lethal force. Ultimately, this standard discourages a full investigation of such incidents. While unintended, this produces negative consequences, including injustice for the victims and their families, danger and fear for future victims, and increased danger to police officers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Crusto","given":"Mitchell F."}],"container-title":"SSRN Electronic Journal","container-title-short":"SSRN Journal","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.3207886","ISSN":"1556-5068","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Right to Life: Interest-Convergence Policing","title-short":"Right to Life","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=3207886"},

  {"id":"cuiMediatizedRitualsUnderstanding2019","abstract":"In this article, I propose the concept of mediatized ritual as a conceptual update to media events and media rituals. With this concept, I intend to better address the ritualistic orientation that privileges an increasingly mediatized social reality constructed through algorithmic collection, processing, and (re)presentation of data and metadata by communication technologies. I argue that to understand mediatized ritual, the media must be understood not as genres or media institutions, but as (1) the technological affordance and human practices of networked access to information and (2) the social perception of tamper-resistance of information, which construct the social reality in a mediatized manner. Blockchain technology and its social nature are analyzed as an example of the utility of the concept. The sociological implications regarding rituals, trust, normalcy, and power-relationship are also discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Cui","given":"Xi"}],"container-title":"International Journal of Communication","ISSN":"1932-8036","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,9]]},"language":"en","number":"0","page":"14","source":"ijoc.org","title":"Mediatized Rituals: Understanding the Media in the Age of Deep Mediatization","title-short":"Mediatized Rituals","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/10798","volume":"13"},

In fact, however, markets arise and operate through law, so that no particular market structure is inevitable and every market order is the result of a complex set of legal and political choices. This introductory Essay organizes the Articles that comprise this Issue of Law and Contemporary Problems, in the light of the legal construction of markets and offers an intellectual roadmap for a legally informed study of the market. Drawing on the insight that markets are plural and open to variable design, we reflect on both the options and constraints faced by law’s architects. We discuss certain risks in market design, including the familiar dangers of unjust distribution and excessive commodification, and the less familiar danger that markets might prove self‐undermining. In order to understand the risks and rewards of market orderings and to take on the responsibility of market design, we close by identifying three idealtypical visions of markets – as efficient, democratic, and liberal – and summarizing the values that these ideal‐types deploy to addresses these challenges.","author":[{"family":"Dagan","given":"Hanoch"},{"family":"Dorfman","given":"Avihay"},{"family":"Kreitner","given":"Roy"},{"family":"Markovits","given":"Daniel"}],"language":"en","page":"23","source":"Zotero","title":"daganh@tauex.tau.ac.il dorfman@tauex.tau.ac.il kreitner@tauex.tau.ac.il daniel.markovits@yale.edu","type":"article-journal"},

The consequence is that alternative traditions of thought in the Americas—e.g., Caribbean traditions—are cast as irrelevant to questions of racial exclusion in U.S. political thinking. I seek to correct nation-centric perspectives on U.S. political thought and development by demonstrating the utility of the “transnational turn.” Drawing on the framework developed in C.L.R. James’s The Black Jacobins, I trace how an influential cohort of abolitionists in the antebellum United States looked to the Haitian Revolution as a model for the overthrow of slavery. Engaging the writings and speeches of David Walker, James Theodore Holly, and Frederick Douglass, I then argue that radical abolitionists operated in the same ideological problem-space as Haitian revolutionaries and adopted a specific model of revolution as much indebted to Haitian political thought as Anglo-American models of anti-colonial revolt. By implication, racially egalitarian movements and moments in U.S. political development cannot be adequately understood with exclusive reference to national traditions of thought.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Dahl","given":"Adam"}],"container-title":"Perspectives on Politics","DOI":"10.1017/S1537592716004151","ISSN":"1537-5927, 1541-0986","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,9]]},"language":"en","page":"633-646","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"The Black American Jacobins: Revolution, Radical Abolition, and the Transnational Turn","title-short":"The Black American Jacobins","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/black-american-jacobins-revolution-radical-abolition-and-the-transnational-turn/5B8F28B41E1AABC2CFC08F9ADCC4942A","volume":"15"},
  {"id":"dahlBlackDisembodimentAge2017","abstract":"One of the more striking features of the Black Lives Matter movement against racialized police brutality has been the focus on violence inflicted on “black bodies.” On one hand, the language of “black bodies,” as opposed to simply “black people” or “black personhood,” makes the issue of racial violence more visceral and immediate to white audiences otherwise indisposed to perceive black pain as a moral problem. On the other hand, it represents a theoretical challenge to dominant understandings of pain, suffering, and individuality based on liberal subjectivity. Exemplifying both of these aspects, Ta-Nehisi Coates’s recent work, Between the World and Me, provides a deep philosophical reflection on the moral and political problem of “black disembodiment.” This article tracks the theme of disembodiment in Coates’s book by foregrounding the role that feminist theories of embodiment play in his exploration of the contemporary black condition in America.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Dahl","given":"Adam"}],"container-title":"New Political Science","DOI":"10.1080/07393148.2017.1339410","ISSN":"0739-3148","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,7,3]]},"page":"319-332","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Black Disembodiment in the Age of Ferguson","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/07393148.2017.1339410","volume":"39"},

  {"id":"dahlgrenInternetPublicSpheres2005","abstract":"The theme of the Internet and the public sphere now has a permanent place on research agendas and in intellectual inquiry; it is entering the mainstream of political communication studies. The first part of this presentation briefly pulls together key elements in the public sphere perspective, underscoring three main analytic dimensions: the structural, the representational, and the interactional. Then the discussion addresses some central themes in the current difficulties facing democracy, refracted through the lens of the public sphere perspective. In particular, the destabilization of political communication systems is seen as a context for understanding the role of the Internet: It enters into, as well as contributes to, this destabilization. At the same time, the notion of destabilization can also embody a positive sense, pointing to dispersions of older patterns that may have outlived their utility. Further, the discussion takes up obvious positive consequences that follow from the Internet, for example that it extends and pluralizes the public sphere in a number of ways. Thereafter the focus moves on to the interactional dimension of the public sphere, specifically in regard to recent research on how deliberation proceeds in the online public sphere in the contemporary environment of political communication. Finally, the analytic category of deliberative democracy is critically examined; while useful, some of its rationalist biases, particularly in the context of extra-parliamentarian politics, limit its utility. It is suggested that the concept of civic cultures offers an alternative way to understand the significance of online political discussion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Dahlgren","given":"Peter"}],"container-title":"Political Communication","DOI":"10.1080/10584600590933160","ISSN":"1058-4609, 1091-7675","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,4]]},"language":"en","page":"147-162","source":"Crossref","title":"The Internet, Public Spheres, and Political Communication: Dispersion and Deliberation","title-short":"The Internet, Public Spheres, and Political Communication","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10584600590933160","volume":"22"},

Legal formalism holds that judges apply legal reasons to the facts of a case in a rational, mechanical, and deliberative manner. In contrast, legal realists argue that the rational application of legal reasons does not sufficiently explain the decisions of judges and that psychological, political, and social factors influence judicial rulings. We test the common caricature of realism that justice is “what the judge ate for breakfast” in sequential parole decisions made by experienced judges. We record the judges’ two daily food breaks, which result in segmenting the deliberations of the day into three distinct “decision sessions.” We find that the percentage of favorable rulings drops gradually from ≈65% to nearly zero within each decision session and returns abruptly to ≈65% after a break. Our findings suggest that judicial rulings can be swayed by extraneous variables that should have no bearing on legal decisions.","author":[{"family":"Danziger","given":"Shai"},{"family":"Levav","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Avnaim-Pesso","given":"Liora"}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","issue":"17","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"page":"6889-6892","title":"Extraneous factors in judicial decisions","title-short":"Extraneous factors in judicial decisions","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/content/108/17/6889.abstract","volume":"108"},

The emergence of phenomena like fake news and hate speech has shown that political discourse on micro-blogging can become strongly polarised by algorithmic enforcement of selective perception. Recent findings suggest that some political actors might employ strategies to actively facilitate polarisation on Twitter. With a network approach, we examine the case of the German far-right party Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) and their potential use of a “hashjacking” strategy (The use of someone else’s hashtag in order to promote one’s own social media agenda.). Our findings suggest that right-wing politicians (and their supporters/retweeters) actively and effectively polarise the discourse not just by using their own party hashtags, but also by “hashjacking” the political party hashtags of other established parties. The results underline the necessity to understand the success of right-wing parties, online and in elections, not entirely as a result of external effects (e.g. migration), but as a direct consequence of their digital political communication strategy.","author":[{"family":"Darius","given":"Philipp"},{"family":"Stephany","given":"Fabian"}],"collection-title":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science","container-title":"Social Informatics","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-34971-4_21","editor":[{"family":"Weber","given":"Ingmar"},{"family":"Darwish","given":"Kareem M."},{"family":"Wagner","given":"Claudia"},{"family":"Zagheni","given":"Emilio"},{"family":"Nelson","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Aref","given":"Samin"},{"family":"Flöck","given":"Fabian"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-030-34971-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"298-308","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Springer Link","title":"“Hashjacking” the Debate: Polarisation Strategies of Germany’s Political Far-Right on Twitter","title-short":"“Hashjacking” the Debate","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"darwinWhatContemporaryWork2017","abstract":"It is conventionally assumed that student ratings perform a significant function in driving improvement in pedagogical practices in higher education. As a result, this form of evaluation has gradually become institutionalised in recent decades as an essential proxy for understanding teaching and course quality in universities across the world. However, with the rise of market-based models in higher education and heightened expectations for accountability mechanisms, the role and functional purpose of ratings-based student evaluation have become increasingly confused. This rising ambiguity has created strong tensions between the seminal drive of student ratings as a tool of quality improvement, and the emerging demands for its use as a transparent accountability measure for the comparative assessment of academic performativity. So are student ratings now largely a tool of quality assurance or performance measurement, or do they remain a legitimate tool for pedagogical improvement? This paper reports on a study that responded to this critical question by considering the contemporary work of student ratings in a major Australian university. The outcomes of this research demonstrate that tension between improvement and accountability motives is causing considerable confusion and discord around the role and value of the student voice. It also reveals that academics are tending to discount the often critical insights of students on the implications of their pedagogical practices as a result of the elevating institutional role of student ratings as a proxy for teaching quality. In considering these outcomes, rising levels of academic dissonance around student ratings would suggest a necessity to consider broadened evaluative strategies that are able to more effectively capture the improvement potential offered by the student voice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Darwin","given":"Stephen"}],"collection-title":"Evaluation of teaching: Challenges and promises","container-title":"Studies in Educational Evaluation","container-title-short":"Studies in Educational Evaluation","DOI":"10.1016/j.stueduc.2016.08.002","ISSN":"0191-491X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,1]]},"page":"13-21","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"What contemporary work are student ratings actually doing in higher education?","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191491X16300074","volume":"54"},
  {"id":"darwishQuantifyingPolarizationTwitter2019","abstract":"This paper addresses polarization quantification, particularly as it pertains to the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the US Supreme Court and his subsequent confirmation with the narrowest margin since 1881. Republican (GOP) and Democratic (DNC) senators voted overwhelmingly along party lines. In this paper, we examine political polarization concerning the nomination among Twitter users. To do so, we accurately identify the stance of more than 128 thousand Twitter users towards Kavanaugh’s nomination using both semi-supervised and supervised classification. Next, we quantify the polarization between the different groups in terms of who they retweet and which hashtags they use. We modify existing polarization quantification measures to make them more efficient and more effective. We also characterize the polarization between users who supported and opposed the nomination.","author":[{"family":"Darwish","given":"Kareem"}],"collection-title":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science","container-title":"Social Informatics","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-34971-4_13","editor":[{"family":"Weber","given":"Ingmar"},{"family":"Darwish","given":"Kareem M."},{"family":"Wagner","given":"Claudia"},{"family":"Zagheni","given":"Emilio"},{"family":"Nelson","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Aref","given":"Samin"},{"family":"Flöck","given":"Fabian"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-030-34971-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"188-201","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Springer Link","title":"Quantifying Polarization on Twitter: The Kavanaugh Nomination","title-short":"Quantifying Polarization on Twitter","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"daskalTamingInternetTrolls","abstract":"Social media platforms have a powerful role as one of the main gatekeepers of the online sphere, alongside search engines and Internet service providers. Yet, given the variety of regulatory mechanisms, technological tools, and nonlegal ethical guidelines employed in regulating content on social media platforms, we argue that there is a need today for a consistent unified formal online content regulation structure. To address this issue, a number of European countries have suggested an old-new policy instrument—the Internet ombudsperson. This article, therefore, develops the concept, firstly by framing it as part of the evolution of the institution of the media ombudsperson. We then describe the theoretical and conceptual framework of Internet ombudsperson and propose future implementations including a traditional national (mainly offline) model as well as an international blockchain model. We conclude by discussing the merits and drawbacks of our proposal as well as its possible theoretical implications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Daskal","given":"Efrat"},{"family":"Wentrup","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Shefet","given":"Dan"}],"container-title":"Policy & Internet","DOI":"10.1002/poi3.227","ISSN":"1944-2866","issue":"n/a","language":"en","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Taming the Internet Trolls With an Internet Ombudsperson: Ethical Social Media Regulation","title-short":"Taming the Internet Trolls With an Internet Ombudsperson","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/poi3.227","volume":"n/a"},
  {"id":"dasOnlineDisinformationRunup2020","abstract":"This essay examines the role of disinformation in the Indian general election of 2019. The findings are presented against the background of previous work on the role of digital media in Indian politics. The essay uses 25 in-depth interviews among ordinary Indians to probe their level of awareness about so-called ‘fake news’. It also examines their behavior in seeking news and sharing political information and their views about the digital campaign strategies of leaders and parties. The interviewees were concerned about the increasing role of religious extremism online. Yet they were also strongly aware of the role of disinformation campaigns and had strategies for working around being misled by information shared on social media. The essay concludes by assessing how disinformation and online extremism are likely to have affected the 2019 election, and makes comparisons with Modi's election in 2014 and with other leaders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Das","given":"Anupam"},{"family":"Schroeder","given":"Ralph"}],"container-title":"Information, Communication & Society","DOI":"10.1080/1369118X.2020.1736123","ISSN":"1369-118X","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,10]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2020.1736123","page":"1-17","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Online disinformation in the run-up to the Indian 2019 election","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2020.1736123","volume":"0"},

  {"id":"davenportProtestingBlackDifferential2011","abstract":"How does the race of protesters affect how police respond to protest events? Drawing on the protest policing literature and on theories of race and ethnic relations, we explore the idea that police view African American protesters as especially threatening and that this threat leads to a greater probability of policing. We examine more than 15,000 protest events that took place in the United States between 1960 and 1990 and find that in many years, African American protest events are more likely than white protest events to draw police presence and that once at events, police are more likely to take action at African American protest events. Additional analyses complicate these findings by showing that they vary over time. In many years, for example, African American protest events are no more likely than white protest events to be policed. While there is support for a “Protesting While Black” phenomenon, it is not invariant across the entire period of inquiry.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Davenport","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Soule","given":"Sarah A."},{"family":"Armstrong","given":"David A."}],"container-title":"American Sociological Review","container-title-short":"Am Sociol Rev","DOI":"10.1177/0003122410395370","ISSN":"0003-1224","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"152-178","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Protesting While Black?: The Differential Policing of American Activism, 1960 to 1990","title-short":"Protesting While Black?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0003122410395370","volume":"76"},

This is done to determine what factors, besides the instructor, have an impact on the raw average student evaluation scores. Most of the previous research on student ratings has been conducted in the US. One significant difference between US and Australian tertiary education is that, on average, the number of foreign undergraduate students in Australia is ten times the number in US institutions. We find that cultural background significantly affects student evaluations. Other factors that have an influence on the average QOT score include: year level; enrolment size; the quantitative nature of the subject; the gender of the student; fee-paying status by gender; course of study; the differences between the course mark and previous marks; the quality of workbooks; the quality of textbooks; and the QOT score relative to those in other subjects taught at the same time. In addition, average QOT scores for instructors who have taught in a mix of subjects are similar to those based on scores adjusted to account for subject and student characteristics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Davies","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Hirschberg","given":"Joe"},{"family":"Lye","given":"Jenny"},{"family":"Johnston","given":"Carol"},{"family":"Mcdonald","given":"Ian"}],"container-title":"Australian Economic Papers","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-8454.2007.00303.x","ISSN":"1467-8454","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"language":"en","page":"18-38","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Systematic Influences on Teaching Evaluations: The Case for Caution*","title-short":"Systematic Influences on Teaching Evaluations","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-8454.2007.00303.x","volume":"46"},

The idea that democratic governments should be open, accessible, and transparent to the governed is receiving renewed emphasis through the combination of government reform efforts and the emergence of advanced technology tools for information access. Although these initiatives are young, they already exhibit daunting complexity, with signiﬁcant management, technology, and policy challenges. A variety of traditional and emerging information policy frameworks offer guidance, while diverse research perspectives highlight both challenges to and opportunities for promoting information-based transparency. Early experience with Data.gov, a central component of the U.S. Open Government Initiative, suggests that two fundamental information policy principles, stewardship and usefulness, can help guide and evaluate efforts to achieve informationbased transparency.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Dawes","given":"Sharon S."}],"container-title":"Government Information Quarterly","DOI":"10.1016/j.giq.2010.07.001","ISSN":"0740624X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,10]]},"language":"en","page":"377-383","source":"Crossref","title":"Stewardship and usefulness: Policy principles for information-based transparency","title-short":"Stewardship and usefulness","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0740624X10000651","volume":"27"},

  {"id":"deBlackPowerConfrontation1969","abstract":"The current racial conflicts in United States involving such issues as housing and education are based as much on issues of poverty and social class as on racism. The gloomy facts of Negro life and living are not relieved by some improvement in his economic conditions. Nearly a quarter of urban Negro marriages are dissolved, a quarter of Negro births are illegitimate, and almost a quarter of Negro families are headed by women. His personal inadequacy and continued inability to establish himself in a traditionally male-dominated culture has forced the Negro to \"base his self-esteem . . . on a kind of behaviour that tended to support a stereotyped picture . . .\" Discrimination against the Negro has been institutionalised through built-in attitudes, inferior education and brutal police hostility. His metamorphosis from Uncle Tomism to aggressive Black Power confrontation has passed through several phases, ending now in the attacks on white property and white police as the twin manifestations of the power system: \"Whitey talks about [why] black people should not be armed when this country was born in violence. What he really wants is to be violent himself and insist that black people be submissive but if s not going to happen that way, not any more.\" The rise of the white backlash in strength is an obvious and significant consequence of the black power confrontation. There seems to be a distinct swing towards racial conservatism — and decadence — among the ranks of white workers and traders. Black militancy on the other hand seems to be moving towards making a community out of the numerous Negroes, active responsible and proud men out of emotional slaves. The programmes of the various black power groups are basically aimed at the economic, political and social resurgence of the Negro, the whys and hows of the future. The Negro's principal ally is the young college kid generation. In a significant way the university is the major action centre for racial desegregation. The most exciting dialogues on race relations are taking place in the university forums.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,5]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"De","given":"Nitish R"}],"container-title":"Economic and Political Weekly","ISSN":"0012-9976","issue":"1/2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1969]]},"page":"115-130","publisher":"Economic and Political Weekly","source":"JSTOR","title":"Black Power Confrontation in United States","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/40736849","volume":"4"},
  {"id":"dechazournesPluralityFabricInternational2017","abstract":"Starting from the observation that there has long been – and continues to be – a preference for a plurality of international courts and tribunals, this article explores the emerging threads of a managerial approach in the fabric of international dispute settlement due to the increased number of fora in recent years. It argues that, while plurality remains the choice, both judges and states are actors in efforts to order this plurality as the need for judicial awareness and tools to organize jurisdiction has become more acute. In particular, judicial actors have woven common normative threads through various communicative practices and their approach to matters of procedure. Further, procedural mechanisms are being used to a greater extent to mitigate the risks of overlapping jurisdiction and parallel proceedings. In this respect, international economic law is serving as a laboratory for the development of these mechanisms. They include, among others, adapted versions of lis pendens, connexité, or fork-in-the-road provisions. That said, similar threads of a managerial approach can be seen to be emerging beyond international economic law. Further reflection is needed on a creative means for ensuring coordination and coherence without compromising the preference for plurality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Chazournes","given":"Laurence Boisson","non-dropping-particle":"de"}],"container-title":"European Journal of International Law","DOI":"10.1093/ejil/chx020","ISSN":"0938-5428, 1464-3596","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"13-72","source":"Crossref","title":"Plurality in the Fabric of International Courts and Tribunals: The Threads of a Managerial Approach","title-short":"Plurality in the Fabric of International Courts and Tribunals","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/ejil/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/ejil/chx020","volume":"28"},

We theorize that the receipt of military equipment increases multiple dimensions of LEA militarization (material, cultural, organizational, and operational) and that such increases lead to more violent behavior. The US Department of Defense 1033 program makes excess military equipment, including weapons and vehicles, available to local LEAs. The variation in the amount of transferred equipment allows us to probe the relationship between military transfers and police violence. We estimate a series of regressions that test the effect of 1033 transfers on three dependent variables meant to capture police violence: the number of civilian casualties; the change in the number of civilian casualties; and the number of dogs killed by police. We find a positive and statistically significant relationship between 1033 transfers and fatalities from officer-involved shootings across all models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Delehanty","given":"Casey"},{"family":"Mewhirter","given":"Jack"},{"family":"Welch","given":"Ryan"},{"family":"Wilks","given":"Jason"}],"container-title":"Research & Politics","container-title-short":"Research & Politics","DOI":"10.1177/2053168017712885","ISSN":"2053-1680, 2053-1680","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,4]]},"language":"en","page":"205316801771288","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Militarization and police violence: The case of the 1033 program","title-short":"Militarization and police violence","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2053168017712885","volume":"4"},

This essay argues that we have a strong prima facie moral right to resist with dignity and that (with certain qualifications) violent resistance is more dignified than nonviolent resistance. Since in some cases dignified resistance will require violence, and since effective violent resistance will sometimes require guns, we have a strong prima facie right to own or carry guns if they are necessary often enough for effective dignified resistance. Since this right holds (to some degree) even when nonviolent means would better achieve the security aims of potential victims, the bar for justifying gun rights is lower than commonly assumed.","author":[{"family":"Demetriou","given":"Dan"}],"language":"en","page":"11","source":"Zotero","title":"Defense with Dignity: How the Dignity of Violent Resistance Informs the Gun Rights Debate","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"dennettElbowRoom2015","abstract":"In this landmark 1984 work on free will, Daniel Dennett makes a case for compatibilism. His aim, as he writes in the preface to this new edition, was a cleanup job, \"saving everything that mattered about the everyday concept of free will, while jettisoning the impediments.\" In Elbow Room, Dennett argues that the varieties of free will worth wanting -- those that underwrite moral and artistic responsibility -- are not threatened by advances in science but distinguished, explained, and justified in detail.Dennett tackles the question of free will in a highly original and witty manner, drawing on the theories and concepts of fields that range from physics and evolutionary biology to engineering, automata theory, and artificial intelligence. He shows how the classical formulations of the problem in philosophy depend on misuses of imagination, and he disentangles the philosophical problems of real interest from the \"family of anxieties\" in which they are often enmeshed -- imaginary agents and bogeymen, including the Peremptory Puppeteer, the Nefarious Neurosurgeon, and the Cosmic Child Whose Dolls We Are. Putting sociobiology in its rightful place, he concludes that we can have free will and science too. He explores reason, control and self-control, the meaning of \"can\" and \"could have done otherwise,\" responsibility and punishment, and why we would want free will in the first place. A fresh reading of Dennett's book shows how much it can still contribute to current discussions of free will. This edition includes as its afterword Dennett's 2012 Erasmus Prize essay.","author":[{"family":"Dennett","given":"Daniel C."}],"collection-title":"The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting","event-place":"Cambridge","ISBN":"0-262-33204-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"number-of-pages":"248","publisher":"MIT Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge","title":"Elbow Room","title-short":"Elbow Room","type":"book","URL":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PN1dCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=dennett+elbow+room&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api"},

Of the items on course evaluation forms, the one that receives the most attention and consequently the most weight is the question, ‘Overall, I was satisfied with the quality of this course.’ However, no attention has been placed on examining the predictors of students being ‘satisfied with the quality of this course’ overall. This study attempts to address this gap. The findings show that while student characteristics and reasons for enrolling in a course are predictors of overall satisfaction, it is the evaluation questions that predict the majority of the variation in course satisfaction. The findings also reveal that faculty‐selected optional questions are stronger predictors of overall satisfaction than compulsory questions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Denson","given":"Nida"},{"family":"Loveday","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Dalton","given":"Helen"}],"container-title":"Higher Education Research & Development","DOI":"10.1080/07294360903394466","ISSN":"0729-4360","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,8,1]]},"page":"339-356","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Student evaluation of courses: what predicts satisfaction?","title-short":"Student evaluation of courses","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/07294360903394466","volume":"29"},

Moreover, the most popular applications available are owned by a small number of companies who may have an undue influence on how civic engagement takes place on their platforms. In this panel, four panelists will discuss the following: misinformation and the role of pseudo-cognitive authorities; hate speech and Germany's Network Enforcement Act (NetzGD); civic engagement and market capture by social media companies; and finally, personal data processing and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

  {"id":"dereuverDigitalPlatformResearch2018","abstract":"As digital platforms are transforming almost every industry today, they are slowly finding their way into the mainstream information systems (ISs) literature. Digital platforms are a challenging research object because of their distributed nature and intertwinement with institutions, markets and technologies. New research challenges arise as a result of the exponentially growing scale of platform innovation, the increasing complexity of platform architectures and the spread of digital platforms to many different industries. This paper develops a research agenda for digital platforms research in IS. We recommend researchers seek to (1) advance conceptual clarity by providing clear definitions that specify the unit of analysis, degree of digitality and the sociotechnical nature of digital platforms; (2) define the proper scoping of digital platform concepts by studying platforms on different architectural levels and in different industry settings; and (3) advance methodological rigour by employing embedded case studies, longitudinal studies, design research, data-driven modelling and visualisation techniques. Considering current developments in the business domain, we suggest six questions for further research: (1) Are platforms here to stay? (2) How should platforms be designed? (3) How do digital platforms transform industries? (4) How can data-driven approaches inform digital platforms research? (5) How should researchers develop theory for digital platforms? and (6) How do digital platforms affect everyday life?","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Reuver","given":"Mark","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Sørensen","given":"Carsten"},{"family":"Basole","given":"Rahul C."}],"container-title":"Journal of Information Technology","container-title-short":"Journal of Information Technology","DOI":"10.1057/s41265-016-0033-3","ISSN":"0268-3962","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"124-135","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The Digital Platform: A Research Agenda","title-short":"The Digital Platform","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1057/s41265-016-0033-3","volume":"33"},

Using an interrupted time series design, this study analyzes how one of Milwaukee’s most publicized cases of police violence against an unarmed black man, the beating of Frank Jude, affected police-related 911 calls. Controlling for crime, prior call patterns, and several neighborhood characteristics, we find that residents of Milwaukee’s neighborhoods, especially residents of black neighborhoods, were far less likely to report crime after Jude’s beating was broadcast. The effect lasted for over a year and resulted in a total net loss of approximately 22,200 calls for service. Other local and national cases of police violence against unarmed black men also had a significant impact on citizen crime reporting in Milwaukee. Police misconduct can powerfully suppress one of the most basic forms of civic engagement: calling 911 for matters of personal and public safety.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Desmond","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Papachristos","given":"Andrew V."},{"family":"Kirk","given":"David S."}],"container-title":"American Sociological Review","container-title-short":"Am Sociol Rev","DOI":"10.1177/0003122416663494","ISSN":"0003-1224","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"857-876","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Police Violence and Citizen Crime Reporting in the Black Community","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0003122416663494","volume":"81"},

The latter development has been accomplished by expansion of thirdparty policing policies; nuisance property ordinances, which sanction landlords for their tenants’ behavior, are among the most popular. This study, an analysis of every nuisance citation distributed in Milwaukee over a two-year period, is among the first to evaluate empirically the impact of coercive third-party policing on the urban poor. Properties in black neighborhoods disproportionately received citations, and those located in more integrated black neighborhoods had the highest likelihood of being deemed nuisances. Nearly a third of all citations were generated by domestic violence; most property owners abated this “nuisance” by evicting battered women. Landlords also took steps to discourage tenants from calling 911; overrepresented among callers, women were disproportionately affected by these measures. By looking beyond traditional policing, this study reveals previously unforeseen consequences of new crime control strategies for women from inner-city neighborhoods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Desmond","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Valdez","given":"Nicol"}],"container-title":"American Sociological Review","container-title-short":"Am Sociol Rev","DOI":"10.1177/0003122412470829","ISSN":"0003-1224, 1939-8271","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,2]]},"language":"en","page":"117-141","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Unpolicing the Urban Poor: Consequences of Third-Party Policing for Inner-City Women","title-short":"Unpolicing the Urban Poor","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0003122412470829","volume":"78"},
  {"id":"desouzaWeaponizingInformationSystems2019","abstract":"Information systems continue to be used by actors who want to undermine public institutions and disrupt political systems. In recent times, actors have engaged in acts of information warfare ranging from attempts to compromising voting systems, to spreading false propaganda and even direct attacks on public infrastructure via information systems. Initial analysis points to the fact that most of these attempts have been successful in achieving their intended objectives. Given this reality, we expect them to intensify and be more creative in the future. In this paper we draw on a critical analysis of the role of information systems in creating political disruption to propose that information systems can be ‘weaponized’ by compromising their goals and values even while they remain protected. Building on this proposition we develop a risk-based Actor, Lever, Effects and Response Taxonomy (ALERT) to assist security practitioners and policymakers to analyze and respond to attacks enabled by information systems aimed at political disruption. We illustrate the utility of ALERT using representative examples of weaponized attacks from credible news sources. Finally, we leverage the insights gained from ALERT to propose a theoretical framework where we assert that over time as actors gain maturity and experience using levers to disrupt political systems, so too does the public sector gain experience in response thus building their response capacity. This dynamic relationship increasingly pushes both actors and defenders to come up with more innovative, agile and sophisticated methods to weaponize and respond to information systems enabled attacks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Desouza","given":"Kevin C."},{"family":"Ahmad","given":"Atif"},{"family":"Naseer","given":"Humza"},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Munish"}],"container-title":"Computers & Security","container-title-short":"Computers & Security","DOI":"10.1016/j.cose.2019.101606","ISSN":"0167-4048","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,15]]},"source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Weaponizing Information Systems for Political Disruption: The Actor, Lever, Effects, and Response Taxonomy (ALERT)","title-short":"Weaponizing Information Systems for Political Disruption","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404819301579"},

Yet as algorithms come to regulate more aspects of our lives, the contours of their power can remain difficult to grasp. This paper studies the notion of algorithmic accountability reporting as a mechanism for elucidating and articulating the power structures, biases, and influences that computational artifacts exercise in society. A framework for algorithmic power based on autonomous decision-making is proffered and motivates specific questions about algorithmic influence. Five cases of algorithmic accountability reporting involving the use of reverse engineering methods in journalism are then studied and analyzed to provide insight into the method and its application in a journalism context. The applicability of transparency policies for algorithms is discussed alongside challenges to implementing algorithmic accountability as a broadly viable investigative method.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Diakopoulos","given":"Nicholas"}],"container-title":"Digital Journalism","DOI":"10.1080/21670811.2014.976411","ISSN":"2167-0811","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,5,4]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/21670811.2014.976411","page":"398-415","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Algorithmic Accountability","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/21670811.2014.976411","volume":"3"},

This paper argues that given insurgency or weakened state capacity, rulers may ﬁnd it best, paradoxically, to reduce the amount of political good it provides as a means of sustaining some amount of their rule. Moreover, although the consequence is political fragmentation and increasing levels of violence, this is not inconsistent with the continuation of attenuated central governance. To evaluate this argument, I select the case of King Stephen’s reign in medieval England. Although far removed historically from contemporary cases of state failure, the reign of King Stephen exhibits just those characteristics of modern, failed states: insurgency, civil war, territorial fragmentation, increasing disorder and violence (even between adherents to the same side of the civil conﬂict), and yet the persistence of some amount of centralized rule.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Dimick","given":"Matthew"}],"container-title":"SSRN Electronic Journal","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.1421459","ISSN":"1556-5068","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"language":"en","source":"Crossref","title":"Lords and Order: Credible Rulers and the Causes of State Failure","title-short":"Lords and Order","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ssrn.com/abstract=1421459"},

In this paper, we introduce a model of organizational networks according to which links are added incrementally to a hierarchical backbone and we test the resulting networks under variable conditions of information exchange. Our main result is the identiﬁcation of a class of multiscale networks that reduce, over a wide range of environments, the likelihood both that individual nodes will suﬀer congestion related failure and also that the network as a whole will disintegrate when failures do occur. We call this dual robustness property of multiscale networks ultrarobustness. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that multiscale networks attain most of their robustness with surprisingly few link additions, suggesting that ultrarobust organizational networks can be generated in an eﬃcient and scalable manner. Our results are directly relevant to the relief of congestion in communication networks and also more broadly to activities, like distributed problem solving, that require individuals to exchange information in an unpredictable manner.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Dodds","given":"P.

  {"id":"donovanSourceHackingMedia2019","abstract":"In recent years there has been an increasing number of online manipulation campaigns targeted at news media. This report focuses on a subset of manipulation campaigns that rely on a strategy we call source hacking: a set of techniques for hiding the sources of problematic information in order to permit its circulation in mainstream media. Source hacking is therefore an indirect method for targeting journalists—planting false information in places that journalists are likely to encounter it or where it will be taken up by other intermediaries. \nAcross eight case studies, we identify the underlying techniques of source hacking to provide journalists, news organizations, platform companies, and others with a new vocabulary for describing these tactics, so that terms such as “trolling” and “trending” do not stand in for concerted eforts to pollute the information environment. In this report, we identify four specific techniques of source hacking: \n1. Viral Sloganeering: repackaging reactionary talking points for social media and press amplification \n2. Leak Forgery: prompting a media spectacle by sharing forged documents \n3. Evidence Collages: compiling information from multiple sources into a single, shareable document, usually as an image \n4. Keyword Squatting: the strategic domination of keywords and sockpuppet accounts to misrepresent groups or individuals \nThese four tactics of source hacking work because networked communication is vulnerable to many diferent styles of attack and finding proof of coordination is not easy to detect. Source hacking techniques complement each other and are often used simultaneously during active manipulation campaigns. These techniques may be carefully coordinated but often rely on partisan support and buy-in from audiences, influencers, and journalists alike. \nWe illustrate these techniques with case studies taken from 2016–2018, and with a specific focus on the manipulation of American politics. We end by ofering a set of suggestions and new concepts for those attempting to identify the operations of manipulation campaigns or to respond to breaking news events: \n• We advise journalists to seek out an abundance of corroborating evidence when reporting on the actions of social media accounts, and whenever possible, verify the identity of account holders. \n• We suggest that newsrooms invest more resources in information security, including creating a position or desk to vet chains of evidence through analysis and verification of metadata for evidence of data craft.\n• We argue that platform companies must label manipulation campaigns when they are identified and provide easier access to metadata associated with accounts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Donovan","given":"Joan"},{"family":"Friedberg","given":"Brian"}],"genre":"Data & Society Report","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,4]]},"language":"en-US","page":"56","publisher":"Data & Society Research Institute","title":"Source Hacking: Media Manipulation in Practice","title-short":"Source Hacking","type":"report","URL":"https://datasociety.net/output/source-hacking-media-manipulation-in-practice/"},

  {"id":"dorfConstitutionDemocraticExperimentalism1998","abstract":"In this Article, Professors Dorf and Sabel identify a new form of government, \"democratic experimentalism,\" in which power is decentralized to enable citizens and other actors to utilize their local knowledge to fit solutions to their individual circumstances, but in which regional and national coordinating bodies require actors to share their knowledge with others facing similar problems. This information pooling, informed by the example of novel kinds of coordination within and among private firms, both increases the efficiency of public administration by encouraging mutual learning among its parts and heightens its accountability through participation of citizens in the decisions that affect them. In democratic experimentalism, subnational units of government are broadly free to set goals and to choose the means to attain them. Regulatory agencies set and ensure compliance with national objectives by means of best-practice performance standards based on information that regulated entities provide in return for the freedom to experiment with solutions they prefer. The authors argue that this type of self-government is currently emerging in settings as diverse as the regulation of nuclear power plants, community policing, procurement of sophisticated military hardware, environmental regulation, and child-protective services. The Article claims further that a shift towards democratic experimentalism holds out the promise of reducing the distance between, on the one hand, the Madisonian ideal of a limited government assured by a complex division of powers and, on the other hand, the governmental reality characteristic of the New Deal synthesis, in which an all-powerful Congress delegates much of its authority to expert agencies that are checked by the courts when they infringe individual rights, but are otherwise assumed to act in the public interest. Professors Dorf and Sabel argue that the combination of decentralization and mutual monitoring intrinsic to democratic experimentalism better protects the constitutional ideal than do doctrines of federalism and the separation of powers, so at odds with current circumstances, that courts recognize the futility of applying them consistently in practice by limiting themselves to fitful declarations of their validity in principle. For example, conventional administrative law imposes external judicial checks on administrative agencies, obliging judges to choose between superficial scrutiny of formal proprieties and disruptive, indeed often paralyzing, inquiry into what an idealized agency might be expected to do. By contrast, democratic experimentalism requires the social actors, separately and in exchange with each other, to take constitutional considerations into account in their decisionmaking. The administrative agency assists the actors even while monitoring their performance by scrutinizing the reactions of each to relevant proposals by the others. The courts then determine whether the agency has met its obligations to foster and generalize the results of this information pooling. Agencies and courts alike use the rich record of the parties' intentions, as interpreted by their acts contained in the continuing, comparative evaluation of experimentation itself. In the administrative and related settings, the aim of democratic experimentalism is to democratize public decisionmaking from within, and so lessen the burdens on a judiciary that today awkwardly superintends the every-day workings of democracy from an external vantage point. Finally, the Article reconceptualizes constitutional rights. Relying in this and other regards on ideas associated with early-twentieth-century American pragmatism, the Article treats disagreements over rights as principally about how to implement widely shared general principles. Under the heading of \"prophylactic rules\" and related doctrines, the United States Supreme Court has recognized that there are often a variety of acceptable remedies for a violation of rights or a variety of acceptable means of achieving a constitutionally mandated end. The authors argue for a radical extension of these doctrines, in which judicial recognition of a general, core right, permits substantial experimentation about how to implement that right. They propose institutional mechanisms to facilitate such experimentation. The authors contend, however, that with rights, as with other constitutionally entrenched principles, means and ends cannot be neatly separated, so that experimentation at the periphery also redefines the core, ultimately challenging the very distinction between core and periphery.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Dorf","given":"Michael C."},{"family":"Sabel","given":"Charles F."}],"container-title":"Columbia Law Review","DOI":"10.2307/1123411","ISSN":"0010-1958","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1998]]},"language":"en","page":"267-473","source":"JSTOR","title":"A Constitution of Democratic Experimentalism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1123411","volume":"98"},

  {"id":"dragiewiczTechnologyFacilitatedCoercive2018","abstract":"This article describes domestic violence as a key context of online misogyny, foregrounding the role of digital media in mediating, coordinating, and regulating it; and proposing an agenda for future research. Scholars and anti-violence advocates have documented the ways digital media exacerbate existing patterns of gendered violence and introduce new modes of abuse, a trend highlighted by this special issue. We propose the term “technology facilitated coercive control” (TFCC) to encompass the technological and relational aspects of patterns of abuse against intimate partners. Our definition of TFCC is grounded in the understanding of domestic violence (DV) as coercive, controlling, and profoundly contextualised in relationship dynamics, cultural norms, and structural inequality. We situate TFCC within the multiple affordances and modes of governance of digital media platforms for amplifying and ameliorating abuse. In addition to investigating TFCC, scholars are beginning to document the ways platforms can engender counter-misogynistic discourse, and are powerful actors for positive change via the regulation and governance of online abuse. Accordingly, we propose four key directions for a TFCC research agenda that recognises and asks new questions about the role of digital media platforms as both facilitators of abuse and potential partners in TFCC prevention and intervention.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Dragiewicz","given":"Molly"},{"family":"Burgess","given":"Jean"},{"family":"Matamoros-Fernández","given":"Ariadna"},{"family":"Salter","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Suzor","given":"Nicolas P."},{"family":"Woodlock","given":"Delanie"},{"family":"Harris","given":"Bridget"}],"container-title":"Feminist Media Studies","DOI":"10.1080/14680777.2018.1447341","ISSN":"1468-0777","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,4]]},"page":"609-625","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Technology facilitated coercive control: domestic violence and the competing roles of digital media platforms","title-short":"Technology facilitated coercive control","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/14680777.2018.1447341","volume":"18"},

We evaluate the elections in light of these objectives.

One of the most noteworthy events over the last quarter-century in U.S. politics is the change in the nature of elite party competition: The parties have become increasingly polarized. Scholars and pundits actively debate how these elite patterns influence polarization among the public (e.g., have citizens also become more ideologically polarized?). Yet, few have addressed what we see as perhaps more fundamental questions: Has elite polarization altered the way citizens arrive at their policy opinions in the first place and, if so, in what ways? We address these questions with a theory and two survey experiments (on the issues of drilling and immigration). We find stark evidence that polarized environments fundamentally change how citizens make decisions. Specifically, polarization intensifies the impact of party endorsements on opinions, decreases the impact of substantive information and, perhaps ironically, stimulates greater confidence in those—less substantively grounded—opinions. We discuss the implications for public opinion formation and the nature of democratic competition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Druckman","given":"James N."},{"family":"Peterson","given":"Erik"},{"family":"Slothuus","given":"Rune"}],"container-title":"American Political Science Review","DOI":"10.1017/S0003055412000500","ISSN":"0003-0554, 1537-5943","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,2]]},"language":"en","page":"57-79","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"How Elite Partisan Polarization Affects Public Opinion Formation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/how-elite-partisan-polarization-affects-public-opinion-formation/6CB23BCCFBFBB4EA3879D91232CEEA59","volume":"107"},

Second, these items all ask respondents about the parties. When individuals answer them, do they think of voters, elites, or both? We demonstrate differences across items, and scholars should carefully think about which items best match their particular research question. Second, we show that when answering questions about the other party, individuals think about elites more than voters. More generally, individuals dislike voters from the other party, but they harbor even more animus toward the other party’s elites.

  {"id":"druzinAnarchyOrderTrade","abstract":"While still fragmented, the world is witnessing the emergence of a global commercial legal order independent of any one national legal system. This process is unfolding both on the macrolevel of state actors as well as on the microlevel of private individuals and organizations. On the macrolevel, the sources of this legal order are complex international agreements; on the microlevel, private contracts employing commercial customary practices and arbitration are driving this process forward. Yet there is no comparable evolution occurring (in any substantial sense) in noncommercial areas of law such as criminal, tort, or family law. There is an overall asymmetry in the development of transnational legal order. But why is this occurring? This Article argues that the emergence of a global commercial legal order may be partially attributed to the unique structural nature of trade. The Article gives a structuralist account, positing that, unlike legal order of a non-commercial nature, commercial legal order has built-in mechanisms that make it particularly suited to evolve in a transnational context—that is, to evolve and sustain itself in the absence of a central legislative or coercive authority. The Article identifies and explores these built-in mechanisms. The Article concludes that, because commercial legal order is uniquely predisposed to emerge without the state, this asymmetry should not only continue but likely grow even more extreme.","author":[{"family":"Druzin","given":"Bryan H"}],"language":"en","page":"43","source":"Zotero","title":"Anarchy, Order, and Trade: A structuralist Account of why a global Commercial Legal Order is emerging","type":"article-journal","volume":"47"},

Private ordering is traditionally defined as the coming together of non-governmental parties in voluntary, self-enforcing arrangements. This Article radically expands the concept of private order to include not only individuals, but also governments themselves, arguing that the ingredients for private ordering exist in both spheres. State actors, perhaps even more so than individuals, are producers of private order in that they regularly establish sophisticated legal order in the absence of centralized enforcement. The Article constructs a theory of private order which focuses on the unique structural properties of contract, and then applies this to the emergence of public international law, arguing that successful treaty-based law should be thought of as a form of contract-based private ordering—one able to emerge because it assigns ongoing positive obligations between parties thereby facilitating signaling.","author":[{"family":"Druzin","given":"Bryan H"}],"container-title":"SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY LAW JOURNAL","language":"en","page":"45","source":"Zotero","title":"Opening the Machinery of Private Order: Public International Law as a Form of Private Ordering","type":"article-journal","volume":"58"},

  {"id":"druzinPlantingSeedsOrder","abstract":"This paper argues that government can strategically trigger the emergence of customary law in order to achieve specific policy ends. While much has been written on customary law, the idea that the State can stimulate its emergence is a radical notion with clear policy implications. Harnessed correctly, such an approach could be a powerful legislative weapon to create, sustain, and even redirect social order. Building upon basic insights from game theory, the paper posits a way to do this: policymakers can deliberately recreate the social conditions that foster the emergence of customary order. The paper, however, draws a sharp divide between the technical and the normative. After laying out how this may technically be achieved, the paper considers the normative legitimacy of this kind of socio-legal engineering, concluding that, while it may be theoretically possible to trigger the emergence of customary law, the normative implications of doing so are quite another matter, and as such it is difficult to see how such policies could ever be casually pursued.","author":[{"family":"Druzin","given":"Bryan H"}],"language":"en","page":"42","source":"Zotero","title":"Planting Seeds of Order: How the State Can Create, Shape, and Use Customary Law","type":"article-journal","volume":"28"},

Building upon the concept of network effects, this article posits a theory as to how legal standardization may occur in a decentralized, spontaneous fashion. To this end, the new lex maritima—with its historically transnational character, reliance on custom, increasing use of international arbitration and the highly networked structure of shipping connections—is used to ﬂesh out a general theory of spontaneous legal standardization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Druzin","given":"Bryan"}],"container-title":"Journal of International Dispute Settlement","DOI":"10.1093/jnlids/idw023","ISSN":"2040-3585, 2040-3593","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,12,23]]},"language":"en","page":"idw023","source":"Crossref","title":"Towards a Theory of Spontaneous Legal Standardization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/jids/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/jnlids/idw023"},

It argues that legal standards are susceptible to network effects. Network effects occur when the value of a standard to a user increases as the number of other agents using the same standard grows, which in turn draws more users to the standard. This can trigger a spontaneous coalescence around a standard in a “snowball effect” fashion. The paper argues that many areas of soft law exhibit strong network effects, rendering such soft law uniquely calibrated to induce voluntary adoption and even compliance. The model helps explain why certain soft law gains traction, and has important implications for international governance. Finally, the paper argues that policy-makers can strategically harness this dynamic to stimulate legal harmonization, but cautions that policy-makers must also remain mindful of the negative consequences that network effects can generate.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Druzin","given":"Bryan H."}],"container-title":"Asian Journal of International Law","DOI":"10.1017/S2044251316000229","ISSN":"2044-2513, 2044-2521","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,7]]},"language":"en","page":"361-378","source":"Crossref","title":"Why does Soft Law Have any Power Anyway?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S2044251316000229/type/journal_article","volume":"7"},

Any system’s democratic qualities can only be evaluated in terms of the polity.

  {"id":"duboisEchoChamberOverstated2018","abstract":"In a high-choice media environment, there are fears that individuals will select media and content that reinforce their existing beliefs and lead to segregation based on interest and/or partisanship. This could lead to partisan echo chambers among those who are politically interested and could contribute to a growing gap in knowledge between those who are politically interested and those who are not. However, the high-choice environment also allows individuals, including those who are politically interested, to consume a wide variety of media, which could lead them to more diverse content and perspectives. This study examines the relationship between political interest as well as media diversity and being caught in an echo chamber (measured by five different variables). Using a nationally representative survey of adult internet users in the United Kingdom (N = 2000), we find that those who are interested in politics and those with diverse media diets tend to avoid echo chambers. This work challenges the impact of echo chambers and tempers fears of partisan segregation since only a small segment of the population are likely to find themselves in an echo chamber. We argue that single media studies and studies which use narrow definitions and measurements of being in an echo chamber are flawed because they do not test the theory in the realistic context of a multiple media environment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Dubois","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Blank","given":"Grant"}],"container-title":"Information, Communication & Society","DOI":"10.1080/1369118X.2018.1428656","ISSN":"1369-118X","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,4]]},"page":"729-745","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The echo chamber is overstated: the moderating effect of political interest and diverse media","title-short":"The echo chamber is overstated","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2018.1428656","volume":"21"},

  {"id":"duffyPlatformPracticesCultural2019","abstract":"The rise of contemporary platforms—from GAFAM in the West to the “three kingdoms” of the Chinese Internet—is reconfiguring the production, distribution, and monetization of cultural content in staggering and complex ways. Given the nature and extent of these transformations, how can we systematically examine the platformization of cultural production? In this introduction, we propose that a comprehensive understanding of this process is as much institutional (markets, governance, and infrastructures), as it is rooted in everyday cultural practices. It is in this vein that we present fourteen original articles that reveal how platformization involves key shifts in practices of labor, creativity, and citizenship. Diverse in their methodological approaches and topical foci, these contributions allow us to see how platformization is unfolding across cultural, geographic, and sectoral-industrial contexts. Despite their breadth and scope, these articles can be mapped along four thematic clusters: continuity and change; diversity and creativity; labor in an age of algorithmic systems; and power, autonomy, and citizenship.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Duffy","given":"Brooke Erin"},{"family":"Poell","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Nieborg","given":"David B."}],"container-title":"Social Media + Society","container-title-short":"Social Media + Society","DOI":"10.1177/2056305119879672","ISSN":"2056-3051","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"2056305119879672","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Platform Practices in the Cultural Industries: Creativity, Labor, and Citizenship","title-short":"Platform Practices in the Cultural Industries","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/2056305119879672","volume":"5"},
  {"id":"duffyTooGoodBe2019","abstract":"While fake news has been widely reviled as an attack on democracy, less has been written about its threat to interpersonal relationships. Social networks have become increasingly popular for sharing news and as a result have also offered fertile ground for the spread of fake news. This paper considers the impact of the latter on the former, particularly in circumstances where the sharer either does not know or does not suspect that the news they are sharing is fake. This distinction is important because while sharing information and news may be construed as a social good, sharing news that turns out to be fake might negatively impact relationships. How do people react when the news they have shared with the intention of fostering social cohesion turns out to be fake, and as a result damages that cohesion? Based on 12 focus groups, this study examines how social media users react to fake news and how it affects interpersonal relationships between sender and receiver.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Duffy","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Tandoc","given":"Edson"},{"family":"Ling","given":"Rich"}],"container-title":"Information, Communication & Society","DOI":"10.1080/1369118X.2019.1623904","ISSN":"1369-118X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,5]]},"page":"1-15","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Too good to be true, too good not to share: the social utility of fake news","title-short":"Too good to be true, too good not to share","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2019.1623904"},
  {"id":"dukePoliticalAuthorityCommon2017","abstract":"This article argues that the natural law common good is the best candidate value to ground a direct justification of political authority. The common good is better placed than rival values to ground a direct justification for three related reasons. First, the common good is the right kind of value to serve in a justification of political authority insofar as it is a reason for action which provides a convincing answer to the fundamental question ‘why have authority at all?’ Second, the common good allows for a justification of political authority that pertains to a complete political community rather than subjects taken individually. Third, the common good allows for a reconciliation of two apparently conflicting features of political authority: (1) its ultimate role is to promote the good of individuals and (2) it can require the subordination of the good of the individual to the good of the community.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Duke","given":"George"}],"container-title":"Political Studies","container-title-short":"Political Studies","DOI":"10.1177/0032321717690767","ISSN":"0032-3217","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"877-892","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Political Authority and the Common Good","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0032321717690767","volume":"65"},

During the past few years, three main approaches have been used to fight botnets. First, police organizations have periodically arrested prominent hackers and scammers, hoping such high-profile operations would have a deterrent effect. Second, Microsoft has performed a number of takedowns, using an innovative blend of legal and technical means that attempt to disrupt botnet operations and reduce their profitability. Third, some countries – Japan, South Korea, Australia, the Netherlands, and Germany – encourage harm reduction strategies that rely on public-private partnerships involving internet service providers, anti-virus companies, and regulatory authorities.

  {"id":"dworkinFreedomLawMoral1996","abstract":"Ronald Dworkin argues that Americans have been systematically misled about what their Constitution is, and how judges decide what it means. The Constitution, he observes, grants individual rights in extremely abstract terms. The First Amendment prohibits the passing of laws that “abridge the freedom of speech”; the Fifth Amendment insists on “due process of law”; and the Fourteenth Amendment demands “equal protection of the laws” for all persons. What does that abstract language mean when it is applied to the political controversies that divide Americans—about affirmative action and racial justice, abortion, euthanasia, capital punishment, censorship, pornography, and homosexuality, for example? Judges, and ultimately the justices of the Supreme Court, must decide for everyone, and that gives them great power. How should they decide?Dworkin defends a particular answer to that question, which he calls the “moral reading” of the Constitution. He argues that the Bill of Rights must be understood as setting out general moral principles about liberty and equality and dignity, and that private citizens, lawyers, and finally judges must interpret and apply those general principles by posing and trying to answer more concrete moral questions. Is freedom to choose abortion really a basic moral right and would curtailing that right be a deep injustice, for example? Why? In the detailed discussions of individual constitutional issues that form the bulk of the book, Dworkin shows that our judges do decide hard constitutional cases by posing and answering such concrete moral questions. Indeed he shows that that is the only way they can decide those cases.But most judges—and most politicians and most law professors—pretend otherwise. They say that judges must never treat constitutional issues as moral issues because that would be “undemocratic”—it would mean that judges were substituting their own moral convictions for those of Congressmen and state legislators who had been elected by the people. So they insist that judges can, and should, decide in some more mechanical way which involves no fresh moral judgment on their part.The result, Dworkin shows, has been great constitutional confusion. Is the premise at the core of this confusion really sound? Is the moral reading—the only reading of the American Constitution that makes sense—really undemocratic? In spirited and illuminating discussions both of the great constitutional cases of recent years, and of general constitutional principles, Dworkin argues, to the contrary, that the distinctly American version of government under principle, based on the moral reading of the Constitution, is in fact the best account of what democracy really is.","author":[{"family":"Dworkin","given":"Ronald"}],"event-place":"Cambridge, MA","ISBN":"978-0-674-31928-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[1996]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"420","publisher":"Harvard University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, MA","source":"Google Books","title":"Freedom's Law: The Moral Reading of the American Constitution","title-short":"Freedom's Law","type":"book"},

That ambivalence also manifests itself within positivist legal theory, which explains the afﬁnity between theories of constituent power and legal positivist accounts of authority.

His account of jury socialization, which stressed lay deference to judges and trust in professional knowledge, was one side of a complex set of ideas about trust and authority in American political thought. Tocqueville’s contemporary Francis Lieber held juries to have important competencies and to be ambivalent rather than deferential regarding court professionals. The nineteenth-century courtroom exhibited such ambivalence and was marked by institutional conflict involving increasing professional authority demanded by the bench and populist counter-pressures. Assessing the value of the jury today may require some of the conceptual tools Tocqueville offers, but must also renew an appreciation of the jury as a site that utilizes already existing juridical capabilities of lay people and thus re-conceive the relationship between lay people and court professionals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Dzur","given":"Albert W."}],"container-title":"Political Theory","DOI":"10.1177/0090591710372863","ISSN":"0090-5917, 1552-7476","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,10]]},"language":"en","page":"603-630","source":"Crossref","title":"Democracy’s “Free School”: Tocqueville and Lieber on the Value of the Jury","title-short":"Democracy’s “Free School”","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0090591710372863","volume":"38"},
  {"id":"eadyHowManyPeople2019","abstract":"A major point of debate in the study of the Internet and politics is the extent to which social media platforms encourage citizens to inhabit online “bubbles” or “echo chambers,” exposed primarily to ideologically congenial political information. To investigate this question, we link a representative survey of Americans with data from respondents’ public Twitter accounts (N = 1,496). We then quantify the ideological distributions of users’ online political and media environments by merging validated estimates of user ideology with the full set of accounts followed by our survey respondents (N = 642,345) and the available tweets posted by those accounts (N ~ 1.2 billion). We study the extent to which liberals and conservatives encounter counter-attitudinal messages in two distinct ways: (a) by the accounts they follow and (b) by the tweets they receive from those accounts, either directly or indirectly (via retweets). More than a third of respondents do not follow any media sources, but among those who do, we find a substantial amount of overlap (51%) in the ideological distributions of accounts followed by users on opposite ends of the political spectrum. At the same time, however, we find asymmetries in individuals’ willingness to venture into cross-cutting spaces, with conservatives more likely to follow media and political accounts classified as left-leaning than the reverse. Finally, we argue that such choices are likely tempered by online news watching behavior.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Eady","given":"Gregory"},{"family":"Nagler","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Guess","given":"Andy"},{"family":"Zilinsky","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Tucker","given":"Joshua A."}],"container-title":"SAGE Open","container-title-short":"SAGE Open","DOI":"10.1177/2158244019832705","ISSN":"2158-2440","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,1]]},"language":"en","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"How Many People Live in Political Bubbles on Social Media?

  {"id":"eaglyNATIONALSTUDYACCESS2015","abstract":"Although immigrants have a right to be represented by counsel in immigration court, it has long been the case that the government has no obligation to provide an attorney for those who are unable to afford one. Recently, however, a broad coalition of public figures, scholars, advocates, courts, and philanthropic foundations have begun to push for the establishment of a public defender system for poor immigrants facing deportation. Yet the national debate about appointing defense counsel for immigrants has proceeded with limited information regarding how many immigrants currently obtain attorneys and the efficacy and efficiency of such representation. This Article presents the results of the first national study of access to counsel in United States immigration courts. Drawing on data from over 1.2 million deportation cases decided between 2007 and 2012, we find that only 37% of all immigrants, and a mere 14% of detained immigrants, secured representation. Only 2% of immigrants obtained pro bono representation from nonprofit organizations, law school clinics, or large law firm volunteer programs. Barriers to representation were particularly severe in immigration courts located in rural areas and small cities, where almost one-third of detained cases were adjudicated. Moreover, we find that immigrants with attorneys fared far better: among similarly situated removal respondents, the odds were fifteen times greater that immigrants with representation, as compared to those without, sought relief, and five-and-a-half times greater that they obtained relief from removal. In addition, we show that involvement of counsel was associated with certain gains in court efficiency: represented respondents brought fewer unmeritorious claims, were more likely to be released from custody, and, once released, were more likely to appear at their future deportation hearings. This research provides an essential data-driven understanding of immigration representation that should inform discussions of expanding access to counsel.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Eagly","given":"Ingrid V."},{"family":"Shafer","given":"Steven"}],"container-title":"University of Pennsylvania Law Review","ISSN":"0041-9907","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"page":"1-91","source":"JSTOR","title":"A NATIONAL STUDY OF ACCESS TO COUNSEL IN IMMIGRATION COURT","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/24752845","volume":"164"},

We review the careers and the research contributions of Williamson and Ostrom to the theory and analysis of economic institutions of governance. Both winners of this Prize for 'economic governance' are thoroughly deserved, yet like the Hayek-Myrdal Prize of 1974 their respective approaches, methods and findings are almost diametrically opposed. Williamson offers a top-down contracts-based solution to the incentive problems of opportunism in corporate governance, whereas Ostrom offers a bottom-up communication-based solution to the governance opportunities of community resources. We offer some critical comments on Williamson's analytic work and discussion of the potential for further application of Ostrom's case-study based experimental methodology. We conclude with a suggested third nominee to make better sense of how these two great scholars' works fit together, namely George Richardson.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Earl","given":"PeterE."},{"family":"Potts","given":"Jason"}],"container-title":"Review of Political Economy","container-title-short":"Review of Political Economy","DOI":"10.1080/09538259.2011.526291","ISSN":"09538259","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,1]]},"page":"1-24","source":"EBSCOhost","title":"A Nobel Prize for Governance and Institutions: Oliver Williamson and Elinor Ostrom","title-short":"A Nobel Prize for Governance and Institutions","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://proxy.lib.uiowa.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=bsh&AN=57225025","volume":"23"},

This research explored whether the combination of honor-related violence and traditional southern politeness norms is related to regional differences in the degree of remorse expressed by those who have committed violent crimes. It was proposed that different social norms regarding politeness and apologies in the Southern United States would be reflected in the narratives provided by offenders. The data came from the final statements that offenders on death row made before they were executed. Results showed that, compared with offenders executed in the non-Southern United States, offenders executed in the South more often apologized for their crimes in their final statements, but they were not necessarily more remorseful.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Eaton","given":"Judy"}],"container-title":"SAGE Open","container-title-short":"SAGE Open","DOI":"10.1177/2158244014529777","ISSN":"2158-2440, 2158-2440","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,6,11]]},"language":"en","page":"215824401452977","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Honor on Death Row: Apology, Remorse, and the Culture of Honor in the U.S. South","title-short":"Honor on Death Row","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2158244014529777","volume":"4"},

To this end, we applied elaboration-likelihood-model (ELM) in web design to explore how central and peripheral cues influence on information evaluation and eye-movement data. The results show that providing central cues such as trusted links and discussion threads encourage the participants to look at the information with more critical thinking compared to the peripheral cues such as number of stars and likes.

  {"id":"economoSocialStructureEndogenous2016","abstract":"Markets, democracies, and organizations rely on accurate aggregate predictions to function properly. A large literature explains how accuracy can arise from diverse predictive models, typically captured as independent or non-perfectly correlated signals. Yet, that literature largely ignores how the diversity of models arises and is maintained. In this paper, we derive equilibrium levels of model diversity as a function of social structure, population size, the probability of experimentation, and the number of available models by building on a theoretical framework used to study biodiversity. We then link model diversity to collective accuracy by generalizing the bias-variance decomposition formula. Assuming equally accurate models, we find that for large populations collective accuracy depends primarily on the diversity of available models and that for small populations, social structure and rates of experimentation also matter. We then show, contrary to intuition, that dividing a population into isolated sub groups does little to increase equilibrium diversity levels. We also extend the model to allow for heterogeneity in accuracy and selection effects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Economo","given":"Evan"},{"family":"Hong","given":"Lu"},{"family":"Page","given":"Scott E."}],"container-title":"Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization","container-title-short":"Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization","DOI":"10.1016/j.jebo.2016.01.003","ISSN":"0167-2681","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"212-231","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Social structure, endogenous diversity, and collective accuracy","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268116000056","volume":"125"},

  {"id":"edelsonSecurityAnalysisFacebook","abstract":"Actors engaged in election disinformation are using online advertising platforms to spread political messages. In response to this threat, online advertising networks have started making political advertising on their platforms more transparent in order to enable third parties to detect malicious advertisers. We present a set of methodologies and perform a security analysis of Facebook’s U.S. Ad Library, which is their political advertising transparency product. Unfortunately, we ﬁnd that there are several weaknesses that enable a malicious advertiser to avoid accurate disclosure of their political ads. We also propose a clustering-based method to detect advertisers engaged in undeclared coordinated activity. Our clustering method identiﬁed 16 clusters of likely inauthentic communities that spent a total of over four million dollars on political advertising. This supports the idea that transparency could be a promising tool for combating disinformation. Finally, based on our ﬁndings, we make recommendations for improving the security of advertising transparency on Facebook and other platforms.","author":[{"family":"Edelson","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Lauinger","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"McCoy","given":"Damon"}],"language":"en","page":"17","source":"Zotero","title":"A Security Analysis of the Facebook Ad Library","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"einspahrStructuralDominationStructural2010","abstract":"After an initial period of feminist theorizing concerned with understanding patriarchy as a structure of male domination, many thinkers turned away from theorizing domination as such and focused instead on women’s (constructed) subjectivity, identity, and agency. While this has fostered important insights into the formation of women’s preferences, desires, and choices, this focus on subjectivity and subject formation has largely overshadowed deeper understandings of patriarchy as a structure of male domination while producing elisions between agency and freedom. In this article, I move to show how domination as a structural concept can help us to reclaim the idea of ‘patriarchy’ as a source of women’s systematic oppression while freedom as non-domination, derived from early republican conceptualizations of freedom, can help us to disambiguate freedom from agency by taking as central the relative positions of actors within social and political structures. Structural freedom as non-domination is thus useful for feminist thinkers in that it gives us critical purchase on the dynamics inherent in unequal social and political relationships and can be linked clearly to the institutions and ideologies that shape and justify interactions between more powerful and less powerful groups. Further, from this point of view intersecting structures of domination can be analysed rather than intersecting identity categories, allowing us to take intersectionality into account and avoiding the need to ground feminist action on a unitary ‘category woman’. Finally, this analysis points toward the radical democratic connexion between freedom and participation in the creation of the material and symbolic structures that frame our collective lives.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Einspahr","given":"Jennifer"}],"container-title":"Feminist Review","container-title-short":"Fem Rev","DOI":"10.1057/fr.2009.40","ISSN":"0141-7789, 1466-4380","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,3]]},"language":"en","page":"1-19","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"structural domination and structural freedom: a feminist perspective","title-short":"structural domination and structural freedom","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1057/fr.2009.40","volume":"94"},

Aggregating the data for 983,491 student evaluations of more than 37,000 course sections, this study examined the trends in the percentage of students expecting the grades of A or A− and students' composite ratings of teaching effectiveness in courses offered between 1980 and 1999. Statistically significant second order polynomial trends over 40 semesters were found for the percentage of A/A− grades and for students ratings of teaching effectiveness. The percentage of students expecting A/A− grades increased steadily by a total of more than 10 percentage points during the 1990s after remaining stable during the 1980s. Student ratings of teaching gradually, but steadily, increased by more than one-tenth of a point after remaining relatively stable during the first half of the 1980s. The predictive relationship between student ratings of teaching and expected grades was significant even after variables related to alternative explanations were statistically controlled. The conclusion that, although generally valid as measures of teaching effectiveness, college students' ratings of instruction may be used in ways that raise questions of consequential validity, specifically by encouraging grade inflation, was supported.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Eiszler","given":"Charles F."}],"container-title":"Research in Higher Education","container-title-short":"Research in Higher Education","DOI":"10.1023/A:1015579817194","ISSN":"1573-188X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002,8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"483-501","source":"Springer Link","title":"College Students' Evaluations of Teaching and Grade Inflation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1015579817194","volume":"43"},

  {"id":"ellermannDiscriminationMigrationCitizenship2019","abstract":"After decades of scholarly optimism that the immigration reforms that swept across the Global North in the postwar era had ushered in a new age of non-discriminatory migration policy, recent scholarship has challenged this narrative. This Special Issue oﬀers an empirical and normative contribution to this critical turn in migration studies by examining the multiple ways in which immigration and citizenship policy continues to create hierarchies among migrants that mirror the intersection of non-meritocratic attributes of social group membership. We show that access to territory and citizenship is governed by highly diﬀerentiated legal distinctions that closely map onto social identities such as gender, race/ethnicity, nationality, religion, and class. This introduction maps two important and interrelated developments in the literature which this issue engages. First, the ‘politics of belonging’ remains shaped by the intersection of multiple axes of inclusion and exclusion that are (re)produced by immigration and citizenship policy. Second, whereas legal precarity has long been associated with undocumented and temporary immigration status, over the past two decades precarity has penetrated all immigration status, including those that have long been understood as secure. The article concludes with an overview of the Special Issue’s individual contributions and identiﬁes some remaining research needs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Ellermann","given":"Antje"}],"container-title":"Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies","DOI":"10.1080/1369183X.2018.1561053","ISSN":"1369-183X, 1469-9451","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,13]]},"language":"en","page":"1-17","source":"Crossref","title":"Discrimination in migration and citizenship","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369183X.2018.1561053"},

  {"id":"emmettFrankKnightDemocracy2011","abstract":"Over the last thirty years of his life, the Chicago economist Frank H. Knight concentrated his efforts on the elaboration of a new liberalism for the post-war era. Three things were necessary, he argued, to restore health to liberalism. First, free society required an appreciation for the basic economic principles of a free market economy, and of their limitations as guides to action. Secondly, democratic society needed to recognize the benefits and limitations of political solutions to social problems. Democratic action was essentially government by discussion, and hence the potential for persuasion, fraudulent speech and salesmanship should be recognized alongside the acceptance of the exploratory nature of all social action. Finally, a free society required free and responsible individuals, which meant that liberalism needed an independent conception of the ethics of freedom.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Emmett","given":"Ross B."}],"event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,8,15]]},"language":"en","number":"ID 1951506","publisher":"Social Science Research Network","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"papers.ssrn.com","title":"Frank H.

This study advances our understanding of the demeanor construct by measuring officers’ perceptions of citizens’ disrespect, non‐compliance, and resistance during traffic stops. Using multilevel statistical models, we examine the correlates of citizens’ demeanor and assess the racial differences in these perceptions. The findings demonstrate that officers’ perceptions of citizens’ demeanor vary across racial/ethnic groups, after controlling for other relevant factors. Although White officers were significantly more likely than Black officers to classify drivers as disrespectful, Black and White officers were equally likely to report drivers as displaying behaviors that were non‐compliant and/or verbally resistant. Black drivers were significantly more likely to be reported as disrespectful, non‐compliant, and/or resistant, regardless of the officers’ race.

  {"id":"engesserPopulismSocialMedia2017","abstract":"Populism is a relevant but contested concept in political communication research. It has been well-researched in political manifestos and the mass media. The present study focuses on another part of the hybrid media system and explores how politicians in four countries (AT, CH, IT, UK) use Facebook and Twitter for populist purposes. Five key elements of populism are derived from the literature: emphasizing the sovereignty of the people, advocating for the people, attacking the elite, ostracizing others, and invoking the ‘heartland’. A qualitative text analysis reveals that populism manifests itself in a fragmented form on social media. Populist statements can be found across countries, parties, and politicians’ status levels. While a broad range of politicians advocate for the people, attacks on the economic elite are preferred by left-wing populists. Attacks on the media elite and ostracism of others, however, are predominantly conducted by right-wing speakers. Overall, the paper provides an in-depth analysis of populism on social media. It shows that social media give the populist actors the freedom to articulate their ideology and spread their messages. The paper also contributes to a reﬁned conceptualization and measurement of populism in future studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Engesser","given":"Sven"},{"family":"Ernst","given":"Nicole"},{"family":"Esser","given":"Frank"},{"family":"Büchel","given":"Florin"}],"container-title":"Information, Communication & Society","DOI":"10.1080/1369118X.2016.1207697","ISSN":"1369-118X, 1468-4462","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,8,3]]},"language":"en","page":"1109-1126","source":"Crossref","title":"Populism and social media: how politicians spread a fragmented ideology","title-short":"Populism and social media","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369118X.2016.1207697","volume":"20"},

The individual contributions discuss how populist actors may benefit from the Internet. They analyze how political leaders and extreme parties use populist online communication. The authors also shed light on how populist movements may relate to various political parties. They finally demonstrate which groups of social media users are more susceptible to populism than others and what effects populist online communication may have on citizens.

  {"id":"epsteinWillCrowdGame2019","abstract":"How can social media platforms effectively fight the spread of fake news and other forms of misinformation online? One possibility is to use newsfeed algorithms to systematically downrank content from low-quality sources. Although this proposal is essentially entirely algorithmic, the challenge lies not in the details of the algorithm, but instead in how to identify the quality of news sources - that is, the real challenge for this approach is a social science challenge. Here we assess the potential utility of crowdsourcing for addressing this challenge. Are laypeople good judges of news source quality? Or are they uninformed, or motivated to “game” the crowdsourcing mechanism in order to advance their partisan agenda? To shed light on thesequestions, we conducted a survey experiment with a sample of Americans that is nationally representative on key demographics in which participants indicated their trust in a range of mainstream, hyper-partisan, and fake news sites. To study the tendency of people to game the system, half of the participants were told that their responses would be shared with social media companies to help inform ranking algorithms. Consistent with prior results on crowdsourcing, we find that our sample of laypeople were quite successful in discriminating between high and low quality content: they provide much higher trust ratings to mainstream sources than hyper-partisan or fake news sources, and their ratings are highly correlated with the ratings of professional checkers. Critically, we show that this successful discernment was unaffected by informing them that their responses would influence ranking algorithms, despite the knowledge manipulation increasing the polarization of trust ratings. Our results have important implications on the deployment of decentralized,scalable approaches to fighting misinformation online.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Epstein","given":"Ziv"},{"family":"Pennycook","given":"Gordon"},{"family":"Rand","given":"David Gertler"}],"container-title":"PsyArXiv Preprints","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/z3s5k","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,5]]},"title":"Will the crowd game the algorithm?

  {"id":"ernstPopulistsPreferSocial2019","abstract":"For studying populism in a hybrid and high-choice media environment, the comparison of various media channels is especially instructive. We argue that populism-related communication is a combination of key messages (content) and certain stylistic devices (form), and we compare their utilization by a broad range of political actors on Facebook, Twitter, and televised talk shows across six countries (CH, DE, FR, IT, UK, and US). We conducted a content analysis of social media and talk show statements (N = 2067) from 31 parties during a nonelection period of 3 months in 2015. We place special emphasis on stylistic devices and find that they can be grouped into three dimensions—equivalent to three dimensions used for populist key messages. We further find that political parties are generally more inclined to use populism-related communication on Facebook and Twitter than in political talk shows and that both new challenger parties and extreme parties use higher amounts of populist key messages and style elements.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Ernst","given":"Nicole"},{"family":"Blassnig","given":"Sina"},{"family":"Engesser","given":"Sven"},{"family":"Büchel","given":"Florin"},{"family":"Esser","given":"Frank"}],"container-title":"Social Media + Society","container-title-short":"Social Media + Society","DOI":"10.1177/2056305118823358","ISSN":"2056-3051","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,16]]},"language":"en","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Populists Prefer Social Media Over Talk Shows: An Analysis of Populist Messages and Stylistic Elements Across Six Countries","title-short":"Populists Prefer Social Media Over Talk Shows","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/2056305118823358","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"etlingNetworkStructureBrokerage2016","abstract":"This thesis investigates the role of network structure, brokerage, and framing in high-risk collective action. I use the protest movement that emerged in Russia following falsified national elections in 2011 and 2012 as an empirical case study. I draw on a unique dataset of nearly 30,000 online documents and the linking structure of over 3,500 Russian Web sites. I employ a range of computational social science methods, including Exponential Random Graph Modeling, an advanced statistical model for social networks, social network analysis, machine learning, and latent semantic analysis. I address three research questions in this thesis. The first asks if a protest network challenging a hybrid regime will have a polycentric or hierarchical structure, and if that structure changes over time. Polycentric networks are conducive to high-risk collective action and are robust to the targeted removal of key nodes, while hierarchical networks can more easily mobilize protesters and spread information. I find that the Russian protest network has a polycentric structure only at the beginning of the protests, and moves towards a less effective hierarchical structure as the movement loses popular support. The second research question seeks to understand if brokered text is actually novel, and if that text is more novel in polycentric networks than in hierarchical ones. Brokers are the individuals or nodes in a network that connect disparate groups through weak ties and close structural holes. Brokers are advantageous because they have access to and spread novel information. I find that the text among nodes in brokered relationships is indeed novel, but that information novelty decreases when networks have a hierarchical structure. The last research question asks if a protest movement in a high-risk political setting can be more successful than the government at spreading its preferred frames, and within such a movement, whether moderate or extremist framing is more prevalent. I find that the opposition is far more effective than the government in spreading its frames, even when the government organizes massive counter protests. Within the movement, moderates are more likely to have their framing adopted online than extremists, unless violence occurs at protests.  The findings suggest that movements should build flatter, more diffuse networks by ensuring that brokers tie together diverse protest constituencies. The findings also provide evidence against those who claim that authoritarian governments are more effective in shaping online discourse than oppositional movements, and also suggest that movements should advance moderate framing in order to attract a wider base of support among the general population.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Etling","given":"Bruce"}],"genre":"Ph.D.","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"eng","note":"Accepted: 2016","publisher":"University of Oxford","source":"ethos.bl.uk","title":"Network structure, brokerage, and framing : how the internet and social media facilitate high-risk collective action","title-short":"Network structure, brokerage, and framing","type":"thesis","URL":"https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:2c08ba3d-2eb0-41ee-ace5-cb1f893c951e"},

One of the hypotheses for this electoral success is that his campaign built a specific communication strategy that used internet platforms to communicate directly with different groups of voters. We describe the Brazilian electoral scenario of 2018, focusing on the use of the messaging app WhatsApp. We discuss how Bolsonaro’s campaign tapped into sentiments and perceptions spread by the legacy media, adding a stronger conservatism. We gather evidence of centralised management of WhatsApp chat groups by political actors that emerge from the work of computer scientists research, newspaper articles and our own ethnographic work. The radicalisation of Brazilian politics could be partially explained as an effect of the use of political micro-targeting in a highly concentrated news media ecosystem, and zero-rating policies that fuels WhatsApp popularity, a platform with affordances that favours the spread of misinformation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Evangelista","given":"Rafael"},{"family":"Bruno","given":"Fernanda"}],"container-title":"Internet Policy Review","DOI":"10.14763/2019.4.1434","ISSN":"2197-6775","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"WhatsApp and political instability in Brazil: targeted messages and political radicalisationWhatsApp and political instability in Brazil: targeted messages and political radicalisation","title-short":"WhatsApp and political instability in Brazil","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://policyreview.info/node/1434"},

While prominent media outlets, such as The New York Times, CNN, and Buzzfeed News, have used the term to designate misleading information spread online, President Donald Trump has used the term as a negative designation of these very “mainstream media.” In this article, we argue that the concept of “fake news” has become an important component in contemporary political struggles. We showcase how the term is utilised by different positions within the social space as means of discrediting, attacking and delegitimising political opponents. Excavating three central moments within the construction of “fake news,” we argue that the term has increasingly become a “floating signifier”: a signifier lodged in-between different hegemonic projects seeking to provide an image of how society is and ought to be structured. By approaching “fake news” from the viewpoint of discourse theory, the paper reframes the current stakes of the debate and contributes with new insights into the function and consequences of “fake news” as a novel political category.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Farkas","given":"Johan"},{"family":"Schou","given":"Jannick"}],"container-title":"Javnost - The Public","DOI":"10.1080/13183222.2018.1463047","ISSN":"1318-3222","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,3]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/13183222.2018.1463047","page":"298-314","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Fake News as a Floating Signifier: Hegemony, Antagonism and the Politics of Falsehood","title-short":"Fake News as a Floating Signifier","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13183222.2018.1463047","volume":"25"},
  {"id":"farkasPostTruthFakeNews2019","abstract":"Western societies are under siege, as fake news, post-truth and alternative facts are undermining the very core of democracy. This dystopian narrative is currently circulated by intellectuals, journalists and policy makers worldwide. In this book, Johan Farkas and Jannick Schou deliver a comprehensive study of post-truth discourses. They critically map the normative ideas contained in these and present a forceful call for deepening democracy.  The dominant narrative of our time is that democracy is in a state of emergency caused by social media, changes to journalism and misinformed masses. This crisis needs to be resolved by reinstating truth at the heart of democracy, even if this means curtailing civic participation and popular sovereignty. Engaging with critical political philosophy, Farkas and Schou argue that these solutions neglect the fact that democracy has never been about truth alone: it is equally about the voice of the democratic people.  Post-Truth, Fake News and Democracy delivers a sobering diagnosis of our times. It maps contemporary discourses on truth and democracy, foregrounds their normative foundations and connects these to historical changes within liberal democracies. The book will be of interest to students and scholars studying the current state and future of democracy, as well as to a politically informed readership.","author":[{"family":"Farkas","given":"Johan"},{"family":"Schou","given":"Jannick"}],"ISBN":"978-1-00-050728-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,23]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"194","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Google Books","title":"Post-Truth, Fake News and Democracy: Mapping the Politics of Falsehood","title-short":"Post-Truth, Fake News and Democracy","type":"book"},

Building a truly comprehensive understanding of democracy as an information system will be a Herculean labor, involving the collective endeavors of political scientists and theorists, computer scientists, scholars of complexity, and others.\n\nIn this short paper, we undertake a more modest task: providing policy advice to improve the resilience of democracy against these attacks. Specifically, we can show how policy makers not only need to think about how to strengthen systems against attacks, but also need to consider how these efforts intersect with public beliefs – or common political knowledge – about these systems, since public beliefs may themselves be an important vector for attacks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Farrell","given":"Henry"},{"family":"Schneier","given":"Bruce"}],"container-title":"Defusing Disinfo","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,28]]},"language":"en","title":"Defending Democracies Against Information Attacks","type":"post-weblog","URL":"https://defusingdis.info/2019/01/28/defending-democratic-mechanisms-and-institutions-against-information-attacks/"},

This article examines the relation between prerogative and liberal constitutionalism by comparing the approaches of two Founders with different conceptions of executive power, Jefferson and Hamilton. Although they both endorsed a Lockean conception of prerogative that makes it possible to secure vital substantive ends that might be imperiled by strict adherence to ordinary legal forms in an emergency, they disagreed over the constitutionality of prerogative. Whereas Hamilton located the authority for prerogative within the implied powers of the Constitution, Jefferson expected presidents to admit wrongdoing and seek post-hoc approval from the public, a difference with important implications for both democracy and constitutional practice that can be traced back to ambiguities in Locke's theory of prerogative.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,9]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Fatovic","given":"Clement"}],"container-title":"American Journal of Political Science","DOI":"10.2307/1519908","ISSN":"0092-5853","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004]]},"page":"429-444","source":"JSTOR","title":"Constitutionalism and Presidential Prerogative: Jeffersonian and Hamiltonian Perspectives","title-short":"Constitutionalism and Presidential Prerogative","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1519908","volume":"48"},
  {"id":"fearonDomesticPoliticalAudiences1994","abstract":"International crises are modeled as a political “war of attrition” in which state leaders choose at each moment whether to attack, back down, or escalate. A leader who backs down suffers audience costs that increase as the public confrontation proceeds. Equilibrium analysis shows how audience costs enable leaders to learn an adversary's true preferences concerning settlement versus war and thus whether and when attack is rational. The model also generates strong comparative statics results, mainly on the question of which side is most likely to back down. Publicly observable measures of relative military capabilities and relative interests prove to have no direct effect once a crisis begins. Instead, relative audience costs matter: the side with a stronger domestic audience (e.g., a democracy) is always less likely to back down than the side less able to generate audience costs (a nondemocracy). More broadly, the analysis suggests that democracies should be able to signal their intentions to other states more credibly and clearly than authoritarian states can, perhaps ameliorating the security dilemma between democratic states.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Fearon","given":"James D."}],"container-title":"American Political Science Review","DOI":"10.2307/2944796","ISSN":"1537-5943, 0003-0554","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[1994,9]]},"language":"en","page":"577-592","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Domestic Political Audiences and the Escalation of International Disputes","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/domestic-political-audiences-and-the-escalation-of-international-disputes/D22E7DE87C4CFBC436AAB3CFE7505962","volume":"88"},

  {"id":"fedePeopleRightsInterpretation2012","abstract":"First published in September 1992, the book traces the nature and development of the fundamental legal relationships among slaves, masters, and third parties. It shows how the colonial and antebellum Southern judges and legislators accommodated slavery’s social relationships into the common law, and how slave law evolved in different states over time in response to social political, economic, and intellectual developments.\n\nThe book states that the law of slavery in the US South treated slaves both as people and property. It reconciles this apparent contradiction by demonstrating that slaves were defined in the law as items of human property without any legal rights. When the lawmakers recognized slaves as people, they burdened slaves with added legal duties and disabilities. This epitomized in legal terms slavery’s oppressive social relationships. The book also illustrates how cases in which the lawmakers recognized slaves as people legitimized slavery’s inhumanity. References in the law to the legal humanity of people held as slaves are shown to be rhetorical devices and cruel ironies that regulated the relative rights of the slaves’ owners and other free people that were embodied in people held as slaves. Thus, it is argued that it never makes sense to think of slave legal rights. This was so even when the lawmakers regulated the individual masters’ rights to treat their slaves as they wished. These regulations advanced policies that the lawmakers perceived to be in the public interest within the context of a slave society.","author":[{"family":"Fede","given":"Andrew"}],"event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-0-415-66971-9 978-0-415-61879-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"language":"English","note":"OCLC: 808492715","publisher":"Routledge","publisher-place":"London","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"People without rights: an interpretation of the fundamentals of the law of slavery in the U.S. South","title-short":"People without rights","type":"book"},

  {"id":"fedinaPoliceViolenceWomen2018","abstract":"Police violence has been identified as a public health concern in the U.S., yet few studies have assessed the prevalence and nature of police violence among women. Furthermore, increasing evidence suggests that women reporting intimate partner violence (IPV) and sexual violence (SV) to police are often met with harmful or neglectful police responses and thus, women's exposures to police violence may be associated with experiences of IPV and SV; however, this has not yet been empirically tested. This study assesses lifetime prevalence and sociodemographic correlates of police violence among women and investigates potential associations between IPV, SV, and police violence. A cross-sectional survey was administered in four Eastern U.S. cities in March and April 2016 (N=932). Physical, sexual, and psychological police victimization and neglect by police were assessed. Logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between IPV, SV, and police violence, adjusting for sociodemographics. Lifetime prevalence of physical (4%), sexual (3.3%), and psychological (14.4%) police violence and neglect (17.2%), show that a notable proportion of women experience police victimization, with significantly higher rates among racial and ethnic minority women. Women with IPV and SV histories had increased odds of experiencing most forms of police violence compared to women without IPV and SV histories.

Increased media selectivity threatens to widen the gap between the politically well-informed and the less-informed by decreasing chance encounters with incidental political information. This study asks: Does exposure to incidental political information through social media promote political learning among users? We conduct two longitudinal, controlled experiments administered through the Facebook platform, and find no statistical difference in the levels of factual political knowledge among participants exposed to political information compared to those who were not. However, those in the treatment group with low political interest may be more likely to venture an incorrect guess than those in the control group, suggesting that exposure to incidental political information through social media may lead to an increase in self-perceived knowledge among some.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Feezell","given":"Jessica T."},{"family":"Ortiz","given":"Brittany"}],"container-title":"Information, Communication & Society","DOI":"10.1080/1369118X.2019.1697340","ISSN":"1369-118X","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,6]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2019.1697340","page":"1-20","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"‘I saw it on Facebook’: an experimental analysis of political learning through social media","title-short":"‘I saw it on Facebook’","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2019.1697340","volume":"0"},

Students (N = 480) evaluated lectures and seminars over three years with a standardised evaluation questionnaire, yielding 4224 data points. The total variance of these student evaluations was separated into the variance components of courses, teachers, students and the student/teacher interaction. The substantial variance components of teachers and courses suggest reliability. However, a similar proportion of variance was due to students, and the interaction of students and teachers was the strongest source of variance. Students’ individual perceptions of teaching and the fit of these perceptions with the particular teacher greatly influence their evaluations. This casts some doubt on the validity of student evaluations as indicators of teaching quality and suggests that aggregated evaluation scores should be used with caution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Feistauer","given":"Daniela"},{"family":"Richter","given":"Tobias"}],"container-title":"Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education","DOI":"10.1080/02602938.2016.1261083","ISSN":"0260-2938","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,11,17]]},"page":"1263-1279","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"How reliable are students’ evaluations of teaching quality?

We trace the concept’s origins, its advantages and challenges, and how the latter might be surmounted. By offering a means for innovative and improvised collaboration, multiple access points for monitoring problems and reducing risks, and inclusive decision-making approaches, polycentric governance provides a valuable framework for CKTS management. However, traditional divisions of labor among intellectual disciplines – as well as other impediments – will require that adjustments be made to permit shared approaches to intellectual work, enhanced means of communication among protagonists, and achievement of common, collective goals that beneﬁt large groups of collaborators and society as a whole – as opposed to merely satisfying the needs of individual CKTS entrepreneurs or investigators.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Feldman","given":"David"}],"container-title":"Handbook of Science and Technology Convergence","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-319-07052-0_71","editor":[{"family":"Bainbridge","given":"William Sims"},{"family":"Roco","given":"Mihail C."}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-319-07051-3 978-3-319-07052-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","page":"877-890","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Crossref","title":"Polycentric Governance","type":"chapter","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-07052-0_71"},

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the Supreme Court imposed national legal and equality norms on recalcitrant southern states that still adhered to a segregated Jim Crow legal regime, and these norms provided the impetus for the Supreme Court's juvenile court “due process” decisions in the 1960s. The article then analyzes sociological, criminological, racial factors, media coverage, and political dynamics of the 1970s and 1980s that contributed to the “get tough” legislative reformulation of juvenile justice policies in the 1990s. During this period, conservative Republican politicians pursued a “southern strategy,” used crime as a code word for race for electoral advantage, and advocated “get tough” policies, which led to punitive changes in juvenile justice laws and practices and have had a disproportionate impact on racial minorities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Feld","given":"Barry C."}],"container-title":"Justice Quarterly","DOI":"10.1080/07418820300095691","ISSN":"0741-8825","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,12,1]]},"page":"765-800","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The politics of race and juvenile justice: The “due process revolution” and the conservative reaction","title-short":"The politics of race and juvenile justice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/07418820300095691","volume":"20"},

  {"id":"felton*WebbasedStudentEvaluations2004","abstract":"College students critique their professors' teaching at RateMyProfessors.com, a web page where students anonymously rate their professors on Quality, Easiness, and Sexiness. Using the self-selected data from this public forum, we examine the relations between quality, easiness, and sexiness for 3190 professors at 25 universities. For faculty with at least ten student posts, the correlation between quality and easiness is 0.61, and the correlation between quality and sexiness is 0.30. Using simple linear regression, we find that about half of the variation in quality is a function of easiness and sexiness. When grouped into sexy and non-sexy professors, the data reveal that students give sexy-rated professors higher quality and easiness scores. If these findings reflect the thinking of American college students when they complete in-class student opinion surveys, then universities need to rethink the validity of student opinion surveys as a measure of teaching effectiveness. High student opinion survey scores might well be viewed with suspicion rather than reverence, since they might indicate a lack of rigor, little student learning, and grade inflation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Felton *","given":"James"},{"family":"Mitchell","given":"John"},{"family":"Stinson","given":"Michael"}],"container-title":"Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education","container-title-short":"Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education","DOI":"10.1080/0260293032000158180","ISSN":"0260-2938","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,2,1]]},"page":"91-108","source":"www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.uiowa.edu (Atypon)","title":"Web-based student evaluations of professors: the relations between perceived quality, easiness and sexiness","title-short":"Web-based student evaluations of professors","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/0260293032000158180","volume":"29"},

Implied in these evaluations is the notion that popular instructors (ie, those considered outstanding by the students) are better educators, whose teaching translates into higher scores for their students on examinations. We tested this hypothesis by comparing students' evaluations of the faculty with levels of academic achievement in a second-year pathology course. Objective measures of academic achievement included scores on final comprehensive examinations, final course grade, and performance on the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE). During the 4 years studied (1990 to 1995), students belonging to groups with the highest ratings for their instruction performed no better than those with the poorest ratings. There was no correlation between students' perceptions of quality in teaching and their academic achievement. Our results indicate that students' evaluations of the faculty are subjective and do not correlate with objective results used in the assessment of student knowledge.

  {"id":"fenwickEndCorporateGovernance2019","abstract":"In a technology-driven, digital world, many of the largest and most successful businesses now operate as ‘platforms’. Such firms leverage networked technologies to facilitate economic exchange, transfer information, connect people, and make predictions. Platform companies are already disrupting multiple industries, including retail, hotels, taxis, and others, and are aggressively moving into new sectors, such as financial services. This paper examines the distinctive features of this new business model and its implications for regulation, notably corporate governance. In particular, the paper suggests that a tension exists between the incentives created by modern corporate governance and the business needs of today’s platforms. The current regulatory framework promotes an unhealthy ‘corporate’ attitude that is failing platforms, and a new direction (what we term ‘platform governance’) is urgently required. In identifying this new regulatory direction, the paper considers how firms might develop as successful platforms. Although there is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ solution, the paper describes three interconnected strategies: (1) leveraging current and near-future digital technologies to create more ‘community-driven’ forms of organization; (2) building an ‘open and accessible platform culture’; and (3) facilitating the creation, curation, and consumption of meaningful ‘content’. The paper concludes that jurisdictions that are the most successful in designing a new ‘platform governance’ based on the promotion of these strategies will be the primary beneficiaries of the digital transformation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Fenwick","given":"Mark"},{"family":"McCahery","given":"Joseph A."},{"family":"Vermeulen","given":"Erik P.

  {"id":"fenwickSustainablePlatformEconomy2019","abstract":"A significant development in the global economy over the last two decades has been the emergence of businesses that organize and define themselves as “platforms.” By platform, we refer to any organization that uses digital or other emerging technologies to create value by facilitating or coordinating connections between two or more groups of users. Think Amazon (connecting buyers and sellers), Facebook (connecting friends and family), or Uber (connecting service providers and service users). Over the last decade, platforms have grown to become some of the largest companies in the world and all companies and other organizations are now obliged to consider integrating platform ideas and experience into their operations. However, platforms are increasingly controversial. Most obviously, they raise concerns about privacy (think Facebook and Google) and market power (think Amazon and Google). And as platforms have expanded in size, they have struggled to maintain their initial promise and brands that were initially disruptive have lost much of their initial appeal (think Facebook or Uber).In this paper, we identify the distinctive features of a “platform business model” (though a comparison with the modern company) and introduce the concept of a “sustainable platform,” to describe a platform-style business that is both innovative and socially responsible. The main argument of the paper is to suggest that there is a “disconnect” between the current business needs and values of sustainable platforms and contemporary policies and regulation, particularly corporate governance. Overcoming this disconnect – developing a new “platform governance” – is crucial for the long-term prospects of sustainable platforms, and the economy more generally.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Fenwick","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Vermeulen","given":"Erik P.

We find that rules appear to be context-dependent for individual subreddits but also share common characteristics across the site. Taken together, our findings provide a rich description of this ecosystem of rules, motivating further inquiry into underlying mechanisms for rule formation and enforcement in online communities.","author":[{"family":"Fiesler","given":"Casey"}],"language":"en","page":"10","source":"Zotero","title":"Reddit Rules!

  {"id":"filippiLawCloudSupremacy2013","abstract":"Cloud computing technologies are commonly used for delivering content or information to users who no longer need to store this data onto their own devices. This is likely to have an important impact on the effectivity of copyright law in the context of online applications, insofar as the underlying infrastructure of the cloud is such that is allows cloud operators to control the manner in which and the extent to which users can exploit such content - regardless of whether it is protected by copyright law or it has already fallen in the public domain. This article analyses the extent to which the provisions of copyright law can potentially be bypassed by cloud computing applications whose interface is designed to regulate the access, use and reuse of online content, and how these online applications can be used to establish private regimes of regulation that often go beyond the scope of the traditional copyright regime.","author":[{"family":"Filippi","given":"Primavera De"}],"issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"en","page":"8","source":"Zotero","title":"Law of the cloud: on the supremacy of the user interface over copyright law","type":"article-journal","volume":"2"},

  {"id":"fineCrimeStoriesCritical1998","abstract":"This qualitative analysis of 154 life-histories with poor and working-class young adults uncovers both broad and deep concern with urban crime and violence. More powerful and unanticipated, however, the analysis reveals how profoundly race, ethnicity, and gender shape the kinds of violence experienced and feared and the kinds of remedies urban residents envision. Overall, the narratives portray urban communities traumatized by three kinds of violence, including street violence, state-initiated violence (e.g., police harassment), and domestic violence. White men speak most directly about street violence, Black and Latino men about police harassment, and women across racial and ethnic groups relate experiences of domestic violence. The article concludes with questions about this triplex of urban violence, asking why national policy, social science scholarship, and media coverage on crime fetishize street violence and yet remain typically silent on both state and domestic abuse.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Fine","given":"Michelle"},{"family":"Weis","given":"Lois"}],"container-title":"International Journal of Qualitative Studies in Education","DOI":"10.1080/095183998236593","ISSN":"0951-8398","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[1998,7,1]]},"page":"435-459","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Crime stories: A critical look through race, ethnicity, and gender","title-short":"Crime stories","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/095183998236593","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"finnWhatAlgorithmsWant2017","abstract":"The gap between theoretical ideas and messy reality, as seen in Neal Stephenson, Adam Smith, and Star Trek.We depend on—we believe in—algorithms to help us get a ride, choose which book to buy, execute a mathematical proof. It's as if we think of code as a magic spell, an incantation to reveal what we need to know and even what we want. Humans have always believed that certain invocations—the marriage vow, the shaman's curse—do not merely describe the world but make it. Computation casts a cultural shadow that is shaped by this long tradition of magical thinking. In this book, Ed Finn considers how the algorithm—in practical terms, “a method for solving a problem”—has its roots not only in mathematical logic but also in cybernetics, philosophy, and magical thinking. Finn argues that the algorithm deploys concepts from the idealized space of computation in a messy reality, with unpredictable and sometimes fascinating results. Drawing on sources that range from Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash to Diderot's Encyclopédie, from Adam Smith to the Star Trek computer, Finn explores the gap between theoretical ideas and pragmatic instructions. He examines the development of intelligent assistants like Siri, the rise of algorithmic aesthetics at Netflix, Ian Bogost's satiric Facebook game Cow Clicker, and the revolutionary economics of Bitcoin. He describes Google's goal of anticipating our questions, Uber's cartoon maps and black box accounting, and what Facebook tells us about programmable value, among other things.If we want to understand the gap between abstraction and messy reality, Finn argues, we need to build a model of “algorithmic reading” and scholarship that attends to process, spearheading a new experimental humanities.","author":[{"family":"Finn","given":"Ed"}],"ISBN":"978-0-262-33884-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,3,6]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"267","publisher":"MIT Press","source":"Google Books","title":"What Algorithms Want: Imagination in the Age of Computing","title-short":"What Algorithms Want","type":"book"},

The Committee’s insistence on the right to privacy and its exterritorial effect is an important first step, but it is not comprehensive, as by remaining within the individual rights framework the UN Human Rights Committee fails to sufficiently take into account the systemic challenges in play. Developing a constitution of the Internet would necessitate not only protecting individual fundamental rights against state interference, but protecting communicative spheres by guaranteeing institutional autonomies and subjecting all social spheres to democratic control; this also requires opening up spaces for a critical public, including whistleblowers, and establishing a right to cryptography – a crucial refraction in the polycentric panoptic schema.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Fischer-Lescano","given":"Andreas"}],"container-title":"Global Constitutionalism","DOI":"10.1017/S204538171600006X","ISSN":"2045-3817, 2045-3825","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,7]]},"language":"en","page":"145-172","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Struggles for a global Internet constitution: protecting global communication structures against surveillance measures","title-short":"Struggles for a global Internet constitution","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/global-constitutionalism/article/struggles-for-a-global-internet-constitution-protecting-global-communication-structures-against-surveillance-measures/4EEC2FA24691EA029DCCF15E2E469B1B","volume":"5"},

Leaving aside those who say they intentionally use social media for news, we compare the number of online news sources used by social media users who do not see it as a news platform, but may come across news while using it (the incidentally exposed), with people who do not use social media at all (non-users). We find that (a) the incidentally exposed users use significantly more online news sources than non-users, (b) the effect of incidental exposure is stronger for younger people and those with low interest in news and (c) stronger for users of YouTube and Twitter than for users of Facebook.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Fletcher","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Nielsen","given":"Rasmus Kleis"}],"container-title":"New Media & Society","DOI":"10.1177/1461444817724170","ISSN":"1461-4448, 1461-7315","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,7]]},"language":"en","page":"2450-2468","source":"Crossref","title":"Are people incidentally exposed to news on social media?

  {"id":"fletcherGeneralisedScepticismHow2019","abstract":"Social media is an increasingly widely used and important source of news. News on social media is ‘selected’ by a variety of actors, including the editors and journalists that produce the content, and the algorithms developed by technology companies to make automatic display decisions based on users’ past behaviour and the actions of their friends. We analyse how people navigate news on social media, and focus on their perception of the different kinds of news selection involved. The analysis uses a mixed-methods design based on focus group material and survey data from Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Across all four countries, with their different political and media systems, we find (i) that the majority do not understand exactly how the information they receive is filtered by algorithms, but they do not uncritically accept it either, because they are sceptical of all forms of selection ‒ including that performed by editors and journalists, (ii) that approval for algorithmic selection is stronger amongst younger people, and (iii) that those with a high level of interest in ‘soft’ news topics (and low interest in ‘hard’ news topics) are more likely to approve of news algorithmically selected on the basis of what their friends have consumed. We argue that the way in which most people navigate news on social media is thus based on a ‘generalised scepticism’ where people question all kinds of selection.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Fletcher","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Nielsen","given":"Rasmus Kleis"}],"container-title":"Information, Communication & Society","DOI":"10.1080/1369118X.2018.1450887","ISSN":"1369-118X","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,15]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2018.1450887","page":"1751-1769","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Generalised scepticism: how people navigate news on social media","title-short":"Generalised scepticism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2018.1450887","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"floridaCitiesCreativeClass2003","abstract":"Cities and regions have long captured the imagination of sociologists, economists, and urbanists. From Alfred Marshall to Robert Park and Jane Jacobs, cities have been seen as cauldrons of diversity and difference and as fonts for creativity and innovation. Yet until recently, social scientists concerned with regional growth and development have focused mainly on the role of firms in cities, and particularly on how these firms make location decisions and to what extent they concentrate together in agglomerations or clusters. This short article summarizes recent advances in our thinking about cities and communities, and does so particularly in light of themes advanced in my recently published book, The Rise of the Creative Class, which focuses on diversity and creativity as basic drivers of innovation and regional and national growth. This line of work further suggests the need for some conceptual refocusing and broadening to account for the location decisions of people as opposed to those of firms as sources of regional and national economic growth. In doing so, this article hopes to spur wider commentary and debate on the critical functions of cities and regions in 21st–century creative capitalism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Florida","given":"Richard"}],"container-title":"City & Community","DOI":"10.1111/1540-6040.00034","ISSN":"1540-6040","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003]]},"language":"en","page":"3-19","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Cities and the Creative Class","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1540-6040.00034","volume":"2"},

  {"id":"flynnMisinformationJustificationSocially2019","abstract":"Attempts to correct political misperceptions often fail. The dominant theoretical explanation for this failure comes from psychological research on motivated reasoning. We identify a novel source of motivated reasoning in response to corrective information: the justification of socially undesirable preferences. Further, we demonstrate that this motivation can, under certain conditions, overpower the motivation to maintain congruence. Our empirical test is a national survey experiment that asks participants to reconcile partisan motivations and the motivation to justify voting against a racial minority candidate. Consistent with our argument, racially prejudiced participants dismiss corrections when misinformation is essential to justify voting against a black candidate of their own party, but accept corrections about an otherwise identical candidate of the opposing party. These results provide new insight into the persistence of certain forms of political misinformation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Flynn","given":"D.

  {"id":"flyverbomDisclosingConcealingInternet2016","abstract":"The ubiquity of digital technologies and the datafication of many domains of social life raise important questions about governance. In the emergent field of internet governance studies, most work has explored novel governance arrangements, institutional developments and the effects of interactions among public and private actors in the emergence of the internet as a matter of concern in global politics. But the digital realm involves more subtle forms of governance and politics that also deserve attention. In this paper, I suggest that the 'ordering' effects of digital infrastructures also revolve around what I term the ‘management of visibilities’. Drawing on insights from science and technology studies and sociologies of visibility, the paper articulates how digital technologies afford and condition ordering through the production of visibilities and the guidance of attention. The basic tenet of the argument is that there is an intimate relationship between seeing, knowing and governing, and that digitalisation and datafication processes fundamentally shape how we make things visible or invisible, knowable or unknowable and governable or ungovernable. Having articulated this conceptual argument, the article offers a number of illustrations of such forms of ordering.","author":[{"family":"Flyverbom","given":"Mikkel"}],"container-title":"internet governance","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","page":"15","source":"Zotero","title":"Disclosing and concealing: internet governance, information control and the management of visibility","type":"article-journal","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"fonJudicialPrecedentsCivil","abstract":"The effect of Civil law doctrines of precedent on the process of formation and evolution of case law is examined. Unlike the Common law systems, Civil law jurisdictions do not adopt a stare decisis principle in adjudication. In deciding any given legal issue, precedents serve a persuasive role. Civil law courts are expected to take past decisions into account when there is a sufficient level of consistency in case law. Generally speaking, no single decision binds a court and no relevance is given to split jurisprudence. Once uniform case law develops, courts treat precedents as a source of “soft” law, taking them into account when reaching a decision. The higher the level of uniformity in past precedents, the greater the persuasive force of case law. Although Civil law jurisdictions do not allow dissenting judges to attach a dissent to a majority opinion, cases that do not conform to the dominant trend serve as a signal of dissent among the judiciary. These cases influence future decisions in varying ways in different legal traditions. Judges may also be influenced by recent jurisprudential trends and fads in case law. The evolution of case law under these doctrines of precedents is modeled, considering the possibility for consolidation, corrosion and stability of legal rules. The effect of different doctrines of precedent on the patterns of evolution of the legal system is studied.","author":[{"family":"Fon","given":"Vincy"},{"family":"Parisi","given":"Francesco"}],"language":"en","page":"22","source":"Zotero","title":"Judicial Precedents in Civil Law Systems: A Dynamic Analysis","type":"article-journal"},

However, despite its centrality to her theory, Nussbaum’s conception of dignity remains under-theorised. In this paper we critically examine the role that dignity plays in Nussbaum’s theory by, first, developing an account of the concept of dignity and introducing a distinction between two types of dignity, status dignity and achievement dignity. Next, drawing on this account, we analyse Nussbaum’s conception of dignity and contrast it with Kant’s conception of dignity. On the basis of this comparison between Nussbaum and Kant, we highlight tensions between Nussbaum’s Aristotelianism, which is central to her conception of dignity, and her commitment to political liberalism. This leads us to conclude that Nussbaum’s claim that her conception of dignity is only a partial political conception is implausible and that her conception of dignity seems to commit her to a satisficing form of perfectionist liberalism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Formosa","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Mackenzie","given":"Catriona"}],"container-title":"Ethical Theory and Moral Practice","DOI":"10.1007/s10677-014-9487-y","ISSN":"1386-2820, 1572-8447","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,11]]},"language":"en","page":"875-892","source":"Crossref","title":"Nussbaum, Kant, and the Capabilities Approach to Dignity","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10677-014-9487-y","volume":"17"},

  {"id":"forsdykeBornEarthPolitical2012","abstract":"AbstractThis paper analyzes the evolution of Athenian myths of their origins from the eighth century to the fourth century BCE. The analysis shows that Athenian myths of origins changed in emphasis and significance according to political needs. In the earliest period (c.800-480 BCE), the Athenians emphasized their descent from earthborn kings who were nurtured by Athena. In this way, the Athenians laid claim to the territory of Attica and to a place in the panhellenic cultural landscape through their connection to Athena. By the mid-fifth century, Athenian myths of origins shifted emphasis in order to stress Athenian superiority over the other Greeks, especially their chief rivals, the Spartans. At this time, the Athenians adopted a new term to describe their origins, namely autochthony. Through this term, the Athenians emphasized their continuous habitation of the territory of Attica, in opposition to those cities (especially Sparta) whose population had emigrated from elsewhere. By the fourth century BCE, the myth changed emphasis again. At this time the Athenians focused on their common birth from the same mother (earth) as a way of affirming the principle of political equality among citizens following the restoration of democracy after the bloody oligarchic revolutions of the late fifth century.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Forsdyke","given":"Sara L."}],"container-title":"Journal of Ancient Near Eastern Religions","DOI":"10.1163/156921212X629491","ISSN":"1569-2124","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"119-141","source":"booksandjournals.brillonline.com","title":"“Born from the Earth”: The Political Uses of an Athenian Myth","title-short":"“Born from the Earth”","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/156921212x629491","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"fowlerSharkAttacksInfluence2018","abstract":"We reassess Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels’s prominent claim that shark attacks influence presidential elections. First, we assemble data on every fatal shark attack in US history and county-level returns from every presidential election between 1872 and 2012, and we find no systematic evidence that shark attacks affect elections. Second, we show that Achen and Bartels’s county-level finding for New Jersey in 1916 becomes substantively smaller and statistically weaker under alternative specifications. Third, we find that their town-level finding in Ocean County significantly shrinks when we correct errors and does not hold for the other beach counties. Finally, implementing placebo tests in settings where there were no shark attacks, we demonstrate that Achen and Bartels’s result was likely to arise even if shark attacks do not influence elections. Overall, there is little compelling evidence that shark attacks influence presidential elections, and any such effect—if one exists—is substantively negligible.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Fowler","given":"Anthony"},{"family":"Hall","given":"Andrew B."}],"container-title":"The Journal of Politics","container-title-short":"The Journal of Politics","DOI":"10.1086/699244","ISSN":"0022-3816","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,6]]},"page":"000-000","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"Do Shark Attacks Influence Presidential Elections?

  {"id":"franciaParanoidStyleRise2019","abstract":"In 1964, Richard Hofstadter authored The Paranoid Style in American Politics. Fifty-five years later in an era now littered with “fake news” websites and conspiracy theories that can spread rapidly over the Internet, Hofstadter’s work warrants revisiting. In this paper, I draw on the concept of the “paranoid style,” but with a quantitative twist. Psychologists Allan Fenigstein and Peter Vanable (1992) developed a survey instrument to assess paranoid thought. Using data from a survey that combines the Fenigstein and Vanable paranoia instrument with questions about present-day political conspiracies and fake news stories, my research asks: Is there a relationship between paranoia and one’s willingness to accept or deny established political facts? I hypothesize that in today’s sometimes confusing information environment, paranoia plays a significant role in understanding why some Americans are more susceptible than others to believing misinformation popularized through fake news websites. The results confirm my expectations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Francia","given":"Peter"}],"container-title":"Annual Meeting of the American Political Science Association","DOI":"10.33774/apsa-2019-p6gq5","event":"Annual Meeting of the American Political Science Association","event-place":"Washington, D.C.","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,24]]},"language":"en","publisher-place":"Washington, D.C.","source":"APSA Preprints","title":"The Paranoid Style and the Rise of Fake News in American Politics","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://preprints.apsanet.org/engage/apsa/article-details/5d87daa9f895ab0012b96232"},

Despite extensive accounts of civil rights mobilization and narratives of state building, there has been surprisingly little research that explicitly examines the importance and consequence that civil rights activism has had for the process of state building in American political and constitutional development. Through a sweeping archival analysis of the NAACP's battle against lynching and mob violence from 1909 to 1923, this book examines how the NAACP raised public awareness, won over American presidents, and secured the support of Congress. In the NAACP's most far-reaching victory, the Supreme Court ruled that the constitutional rights of black defendants were violated by a white mob in the landmark criminal procedure decision Moore v. Dempsey.

  {"id":"freelonMeasureMovementQuantifying2019","abstract":"The revolution in digital communications has altered the relationship between citizens and political elites, with important implications for democracy. As new information ecosystems have evolved, as unforeseen examples of their positive and negative consequences have emerged, and as theorizing, data, and research methods have expanded and improved, the central question has shifted from if the digital information environment is good or bad for democratic politics to how and in what contexts particular attributes of this environment are having an influence. It is only through the careful analysis of specific cases that we can begin to build a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the role of digital media in democratic theory and practice. The essays in Digital Media and Democratic Futures focus on a variety of information and communication technologies, politically relevant actors, substantive issues, and digital political practices, doing so from distinct theoretical perspectives and methodological approaches. Individually, each of these case studies provides deep insights into the complex and context-dependent relationship between media and democracy. Collectively, they show that there is no single outcome for democracy in the digital age, only a range of possible futures. Contributors: Rena Bivens, Michael X.

This study develops and measures three theoretically grounded metrics of social media power—unity, numbers, and commitment—as wielded on Twitter by a social movement (Black Lives Matter [BLM]), a counter-movement (political conservatives), and an unaligned party (mainstream news outlets) over nearly 10 months. We find evidence of a model of social media efficacy in which BLM predicts mainstream news coverage of police brutality, which in turn is the strongest driver of attention to the issue from political elites. Critically, the metric that best predicts elite response across all parties is commitment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Freelon","given":"Deen"},{"family":"McIlwain","given":"Charlton"},{"family":"Clark","given":"Meredith"}],"container-title":"New Media & Society","container-title-short":"New Media & Society","DOI":"10.1177/1461444816676646","ISSN":"1461-4448","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"990-1011","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Quantifying the power and consequences of social media protest","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444816676646","volume":"20"},

This article finds that Section 5 coverage increased black voter registration by 14–19 percentage points, white registration by 10–13 percentage points, and overall voter turnout by 10–19 percentage points. Additional results for Democratic vote share suggest that some of this overall increase in turnout may have come from reactionary whites.

  {"id":"friedProgressiveAssaultLaissez2001","abstract":"Law and economics is the leading intellectual movement in law today. This book examines the first great law and economics movement in the early part of the twentieth century through the work of one of its most original thinkers, Robert Hale. Beginning in the 1890s and continuing through the 1930s, progressive academics in law and economics mounted parallel assaults on free-market economic principles. They showed first that private, unregulated economic relations were in fact determined by a state-imposed regime of property and contract rights. Second, they showed that the particular regime of rights that existed at that time was hard to square with any common-sense notions of social justice. Today, Hale is best known among contemporary legal academics and philosophers for his groundbreaking writings on coercion and consent in market relations. The bulk of his writing, however, consisted of a critique of natural property rights. Taken together, these writings on coercion and property rights offer one of the most profound and elaborated critiques of libertarianism, far outshining the better-known efforts of Richard Ely and John R.

How is it that a book that is frequently described as flawed continues to inform contemporary scholarship on race and slavery?

Specifically, the article discusses how some of the central premises of Tannenbaum's approach continue to inform the work of current scholars. Three of these premises are discussed in some detail: first, that “Anglo” and “Latin” America constituted two separate entities; second, that race relations in each area were fundamentally different; and third, that differences in modern race relations could only be explained by their divergent “slave systems.”","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Fuente","given":"Alejandro","dropping-particle":"de la"}],"container-title":"International Labor and Working-Class History","DOI":"10.1017/S0147547909990305","ISSN":"1471-6445, 0147-5479","issue":"1","issued":{"literal":"2010/ed"},"language":"en","page":"154-173","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"From Slaves to Citizens?

Although analysts note that state capitalism is associated with political illiberalism, there is little inquiry into how these authoritarian regimes maintain power at home. This chapter explores the domestic configuration of state capitalism in China. Through a discussion of China’s labor legislation and labor market institutions over the reform period, it argues that China has thus far successfully maintained a balance between two contradictory impulses: statist control and market competition. It focuses on three main areas that demonstrate the state’s adaptation over time: (1) market versus regulatory mechanisms to manage labor, (2) exclusionary versus inclusionary modes of social welfare, and (3) a detached versus embedded role of the state in social conflict. The state’s approach to labor issues has evolved over the reform period, shifting from a detached state relying on market mechanisms to a more embedded state relying on regulation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Gallagher","given":"Mary E."}],"container-title":"Regulating the Visible Hand?: The Institutional Implications of Chinese State Capitalism","editor":[{"family":"Liebman","given":"Benjamin L."},{"family":"Milhaupt","given":"Curtis J."}],"event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-19-025028-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,12,1]]},"language":"en_US","page":"225-249","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"New York","source":"www.oxfordscholarship.com","title":"The Social Relations of Chinese State Capitalism","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190250256.001.0001/acprof-9780190250256-chapter-10"},

Utilizing channel positioning as an instrument for viewership, we show that exposure to the conservative Fox News Channel shrinks local government budgets, while liberal MSNBC enlarges them. Revenue changes are driven by shifts in property taxes, a key tool for local redistributive policy. Expenditure changes are drivenby public hospital expenditures, an important discretionary public good provided by local governments. We also find evidence that Fox News exposure increased privatization (while MSNBC decreased it). An analysis of mechanisms suggests that the results are driven by changes in voter preferences, but not by changes in partisan control of city governments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Galletta","given":"Sergio"},{"family":"Ash","given":"Elliott"}],"event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,12]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Social Science Research Network","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"papers.ssrn.com","title":"How Cable News Reshaped Local Government","type":"report","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3370908"},

  {"id":"ganHumanDignityRight2009","abstract":"The concept of human dignity and the relationship between dignity and human rights have been important subjects in contemporary international academia. This article first analyzes the different understandings of the concept of dignity, which has left great influences in history (including the “theory of attribution-dignity”, the “theory of autonomy-dignity” or the “theory of moral completeness/achievement-dignity”, and the “theory of end-in-itself-dignity”); it then exposes the obvious defects of these modes of understanding; finally, it tries to define dignity as a moral right to be free from insult. Meanwhile, the relationship between human dignity and human rights is clarified as a result of this research: Rather than being the foundation of human rights, human dignity is one of human rights. The idea of dignity nevertheless has a particular status in ethics in that it embodies a kind of core moral concern, representing a basic demand rooted in the human self or individuality, and hence representing an important aspect of human rights. We may anticipate that sooner or later, the idea of human dignity will become, together with other human rights, the only intangible cultural heritage of human society.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Gan","given":"Shaoping"}],"container-title":"Frontiers of Philosophy in China","DOI":"10.1007/s11466-009-0024-3","ISSN":"1673-3436, 1673-355X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,9]]},"language":"en","page":"370-384","source":"Crossref","title":"Human dignity as a right","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/10.1007/s11466-009-0024-3","volume":"4"},

The investigation was conducted at a large, comprehensive, research-intensive Australian university. It drew on the data from a survey administered to all students in all units of undergraduate and postgraduate study conducted across the university over four semesters.

  {"id":"gans-morseDemandLawSecurity2017","abstract":"Studies of property rights overwhelmingly focus on whether states expropriate or protect property, overlooking the crucial issue of whether private sector actors will\n              use\n              state institutions. By contrast, I argue that the “supply” of formal legal institutions often fails to ensure firms will rely on the state for property rights protection. Instead, firms frequently avoid formal legal institutions and turn to illegal strategies based on violence or corruption. Whether firms adopt legal strategies depends on: (1) firm-level practices and beliefs that impede the use of law, (2) the effectiveness of illegal strategies, and (3) coordination problems resulting from firms’ expectations about each other’s strategies. Drawing on interviews with firms, lawyers, and private security agencies, as well as an original survey of Russian enterprises, I illustrate how “demand-side” factors led to a surprising increase in Russian firms’ reliance on formal legal institutions over the past two decades. The findings suggest that comprehensive understanding of property rights and the rule of law requires not only attention to state institutions’ effectiveness, but also to private actors’ strategies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Gans-Morse","given":"Jordan"}],"container-title":"American Political Science Review","container-title-short":"Am Polit Sci Rev","DOI":"10.1017/S0003055416000691","ISSN":"0003-0554, 1537-5943","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,5]]},"language":"en","page":"338-359","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Demand for Law and the Security of Property Rights: The Case of Post-Soviet Russia","title-short":"Demand for Law and the Security of Property Rights","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0003055416000691/type/journal_article","volume":"111"},
  {"id":"gans-morseTaxesBankingLegal2020","abstract":"A significant challenge faced by rule-oflaw reformers is that newly created legal institutions frequently remain divorced from the de facto rules governing economic transactions. Firms instead rely on informal, and sometimes illegal, means of enforcing contracts, protecting property, and resolving disputes. This article proposes that one key to overcoming the chasm between formal legal institutions and on-theground practices is to adopt a broader understanding of legal development. In many cases, developments in spheres that are only indirectly related to formal legal institutions may be equally important, particularly if these developments either (1) increase the costs of illicit alternatives to reliance on law or (2) reduce barriers to firms’ use of formal legal institutions. This article illustrates the argument with two key examples in post-Soviet Russia: banking sector development and improved tax compliance.","author":[{"family":"Gans-Morse","given":"Jordan"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","page":"30","source":"Zotero","title":"Taxes, Banking, and Legal Development in Russia: Lessons about Institutional Complementarities and the Rule of Law","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"gans-morseTripleThreatProperty","abstract":"Although prominent studies portray predatory rulers as the primary threat to property rights, lower-level state oﬃcials and unlawful private actors pose equally severe challenges. Secure property rights require mechanisms that (1) credibly constrain rulers, (2) resolve principal-agent problems between rulers and bureaucrats, and (3) reduce ﬁrms’ reliance on private coercion. Analyzing a formal model of this “triple threat” reveals three key ﬁndings. First, rulers’ credible commitment to respect property is insuﬃcient to deter threats from lower-level oﬃcials and private actors. Second, lowerlevel oﬃcials’ predation and private actors’ coercion not only directly threaten property rights but also exacerbate rulers’ credible commitment dilemmas. Third, property security frequently depends more on state capacity than on constraining rulers. These ﬁndings suggest that a narrow focus on credible commitment underestimates threats to property rights, shedding light on why many countries struggle to secure property and build rule of law, even when rulers are institutionally constrained.","author":[{"family":"Gans-Morse","given":"Jordan"}],"language":"en","page":"34","source":"Zotero","title":"The Triple Threat to Property Rights:","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"garcia-bernardoSocialMediaAffects2018","abstract":"Over the past two decades, school shootings within the United States have repeatedly devastated communities and shaken public opinion. Many of these attacks appear to be `lone wolf' ones driven by specific individual motivations, and the identification of precursor signals and hence actionable policy measures would thus seem highly unlikely. Here, we take a system-wide view and investigate the timing of school attacks and the dynamical feedback with social media. We identify a trend divergence in which college attacks have continued to accelerate over the last 25 years while those carried out on K-12 schools have slowed down. We establish the copycat effect in school shootings and uncover a statistical association between social media chatter and the probability of an attack in the following days. While hinting at causality, this relationship may also help mitigate the frequency and intensity of future attacks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Garcia-Bernardo","given":"J."},{"family":"Qi","given":"H."},{"family":"Shultz","given":"J.

  {"id":"garciaSocialResilienceOnline2013","abstract":"We empirically analyze five online communities: Friendster, Livejournal, Facebook, Orkut, Myspace, to identify causes for the decline of social networks. We define social resilience as the ability of a community to withstand changes. We do not argue about the cause of such changes, but concentrate on their impact. Changes may cause users to leave, which may trigger further leaves of others who lost connection to their friends. This may lead to cascades of users leaving. A social network is said to be resilient if the size of such cascades can be limited. To quantify resilience, we use the k-core analysis, to identify subsets of the network in which all users have at least k friends. These connections generate benefits (b) for each user, which have to outweigh the costs (c) of being a member of the network. If this difference is not positive, users leave. After all cascades, the remaining network is the k-core of the original network determined by the cost-to-benefit c/b ratio. By analysing the cumulative distribution of k-cores we are able to calculate the number of users remaining in each community. This allows us to infer the impact of the c/b ratio on the resilience of these online communities. We find that the different online communities have different k-core distributions. Consequently, similar changes in the c/b ratio have a different impact on the amount of active users. As a case study, we focus on the evolution of Friendster. We identify time periods when new users entering the network observed an insufficient c/b ratio. This measure can be seen as a precursor of the later collapse of the community. Our analysis can be applied to estimate the impact of changes in the user interface, which may temporarily increase the c/b ratio, thus posing a threat for the community to shrink, or even to collapse.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Garcia","given":"David"},{"family":"Mavrodiev","given":"Pavlin"},{"family":"Schweitzer","given":"Frank"}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the first ACM conference on Online social networks - COSN '13","DOI":"10.1145/2512938.2512946","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"page":"39-50","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Social Resilience in Online Communities: The Autopsy of Friendster","title-short":"Social Resilience in Online Communities","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6109"},

This new, third model of constitutionalism attempts to straddle the previous dichotomy of traditional parliamentary sovereignty and constitutional or judicial supremacy by adequately and effectively protecting rights through a reallocation of powers between courts and legislatures which brings them into greater balance than under these two preexisting, more lopsided models. The article considers the extent to which the new model is achieving these twin goals—protecting rights and balancing judicial and legislative powers—through a critical evaluation of recent experience under its various versions in Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom and the mostly country-specific academic commentary on all aspects of its workings. The article concludes that the new model has for the most part been moderately successful and distinctive in practice, and proposes a few working adjustments that might make it more so in the future.","author":[{"family":"Gardbaum","given":"Stephen"}],"container-title":"International Journal of Constitutional Law","container-title-short":"International Journal of Constitutional Law","DOI":"10.1093/icon/moq007","ISSN":"1474-2640","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,4,1]]},"page":"167-206","title":"Reassessing the new Commonwealth model of constitutionalism","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icon/moq007","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"gardnerPOLICEVIOLENCEAFRICAN","abstract":"How should an African American respond to a race-based police stop? What approach, disposition, or tactic will minimize his risk within the context of the police stop of being subject to police violence? This Essay advances a conversation among criminal procedural theorists about citizen agency within the field of police-administered criminal procedure, highlighting “The Talk” that parents have with their African American children regarding how to respond to police seizure. It argues that the most prominent version of The Talk—the one in which parents call for absolute deference to police authority in the event of a police stop—may be as reasonable as it is ineffective. If African Americans, as a matter of course, respond to the race-based stop with unqualified submission to police authority, the race-based stop becomes a tidy and efficient exercise, the ease of which is likely to raise the rate at which African Americans are stopped and battered by police. Blanket conformity would seem to create a deleterious feedback loop for this targeted racial cohort. African Americans could instead opt for a discrete, transactional form of nonconformity in response to the race-based stop—one that accords with the principle of police accountability. Rather than reflexive submission, when subject to such stops African Americans could follow a nonconformist protocol that includes a request for the name and badge number of the seizing officer(s) followed by the filing of a formal complaint. I identify these and similar discretionary maneuvers taken during and after the race-based police stop as “administrative nonconformity.” Such practices require an alternative disposition toward the race-based stop—a reformulation of the African American procedural habitus.","author":[{"family":"Gardner","given":"Trevor George"}],"container-title":"BOSTON UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW","language":"en","page":"45","source":"Zotero","title":"POLICE VIOLENCE AND THE AFRICAN AMERICAN PROCEDURAL HABITUS","type":"article-journal","volume":"100"},
  {"id":"garlandPenalExcessSurplus2005","abstract":"The most notorious lynchings that occurred in the United States between 1890 and 1940 involved publicity, crowds, ritual, and abnormal cruelty. Several hundred of these “public torture lynchings” took place, most of them in the Deep South. The author develops an interpretation that takes seriously the specific forms and discourses that lynchers and their supporters used to describe and justify these events—characterizing them as criminal punishments, albeit summary, informal ones that were shaped by a white supremacist culture and a politics of racial domination. An interpretation of the penal context and meanings of these public torture lynchings helps us understand their specific forms and their claims to legitimacy. The penal character of these lynchings increased the probability that they would be tolerated by local (and even national) audiences and thus made them a strategic form of violence in struggles to maintain racial supremacy. The author argues that a consideration of these events should lead us to revise our standard narratives about the evolution of modern punishments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Garland","given":"David"}],"container-title":"Law & Society Review","DOI":"10.1111/j.1540-5893.2005.00245.x","ISSN":"1540-5893","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005]]},"language":"en","page":"793-834","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Penal Excess and Surplus Meaning: Public Torture Lynchings in Twentieth-Century America","title-short":"Penal Excess and Surplus Meaning","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-5893.2005.00245.x","volume":"39"},

Among the central results of the paper are (1) corruption is especially problematic under monopolistic enforcement, (2) when governmental decision making is divided, a rent-seeking group which is unable to control the level of fines and rewards usually prefers monopolistic to competitive enforcement.

  {"id":"garrettSocialMediaContribution2019","abstract":"There is considerable concern about the role that social media, such as Facebook and Twitter, play in promoting misperceptions during political campaigns. These technologies are widely used, and inaccurate information flowing across them has a high profile. This research uses three-wave panel surveys conducted with representative samples of Americans during both the 2012 and 2016 U.S. Presidential elections to assess whether use of social media for political information promoted endorsement of falsehoods about major party candidates or important campaign issues. Fixed effects regression helps ensure that observed effects are not due to individual differences. Results indicate that social media use had a small but significant influence on misperceptions about President Obama in the 2012 election, and that this effect was most pronounced among strong partisans. Social media had no effect on belief accuracy about the Republican candidate in that election. The 2016 survey focused on campaign issues. There is no evidence that social media use influenced belief accuracy about these topics in aggregate, but Facebook users were unique. Social media use by this group reduced issue misperceptions relative to those who only used other social media. These results demonstrate that social media can alter citizens’ willingness to endorse falsehoods during an election, but that the effects are often small.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Garrett","given":"R.

  {"id":"gerardsAccessJusticeEuropean2017","abstract":"The numerous reforms to the Convention system of the past two decades have unquestionably had an effect on applicants’ means to access justice in the system. It is, however, open to question how these changes should be evaluated: with reference to the individual right to petition, or with reference to a more substantive and general conception of access to justice. This article explores these two approaches to the notion of access to justice both generally and for the Convention system specifically. The main argument of the article is to show the value of taking a substantive approach to access to justice in the Convention system. Thus, it challenges the centrality of the individual right to petition in discussions on reform of the system. Further, to show how taking a different perspective on access to justice may lead to different analyses, an evaluation in the light of both approaches is made of five sets of central changes to the Court’s procedure and its working method. This includes the revised Rule 47, single-judge formations and the priority policy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Gerards","given":"Janneke H."},{"family":"Glas","given":"Lize R."}],"container-title":"Netherlands Quarterly of Human Rights","DOI":"10.1177/0924051917693988","ISSN":"0924-0519, 2214-7357","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,3]]},"language":"en","page":"11-30","source":"Crossref","title":"Access to justice in the European Convention on Human Rights system","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0924051917693988","volume":"35"},

  {"id":"ghoshAnalyzingPoliticalAdvertisers","abstract":"The popularity of online advertising—now with aggregate revenues in the hundreds of billions of dollars each year—is strongly driven by targeting, or the ability of an advertising platform to help an advertiser select exactly which users should see their ad. To enable such targeting, advertising platforms routinely collect detailed data on users, a practice which has led to a raucous debate over privacy. Unfortunately, regulators and the public at large often have little visibility into how these advertising platforms implement their targeting features or how they are being used. Recent events, however, have caused platforms to start offering limited transparency for political ads. In this paper, we focus on Facebook and collect data from Facebook’s Political Ad Archive on all political ads from a large list of political advertisers. We then cross-reference this data set with the crowdsourced ProPublica Political Ad Database (which contains information about ads’ targeting parameters), allowing us to have ground truth data on advertising campaigns’ impressions, money spent, and use of targeting features. Analyzing the resulting data set, we ﬁnd that well-funded advertisers tend to use privacy-sensitive targeting features more frequently and that less-well-funded advertisers tend to more narrowly target their audiences geographically. We make the resulting data sets available to the community to enable further study.","author":[{"family":"Ghosh","given":"Avijit"},{"family":"Venkatadri","given":"Giridhari"},{"family":"Mislove","given":"Alan"}],"language":"en","page":"7","source":"Zotero","title":"Analyzing Political Advertisers’ Use of Facebook’s Targeting Features","type":"article-journal"},

These changes reflected-or will soon most likely reflect-in changing policy approaches. Online Service Providers (OSPs)' role is unprecedented for their capacity to influence the informational environment and users' interactions within it. The ethical implications of OSPs' role in contemporary information societies are raising unprecedented social challenges. The decisions made by these platforms increasingly shape contemporary life. Therefore, whether and when access providers and communications platforms like Google, Twitter and Facebook are liable for their users' online activities is a key factor that affects innovation and fundamental rights. There are emerging legal, policy and ethical issues facing online intermediaries that have so far received miscellaneous and inconsistent answers even within the same jurisdiction.

Section I and II provide a taxonomy of internet platforms, a general discussion of possible basis for liability and remedies, while putting into context intermediary liability regulation with fundamental rights and he ethical implications of the intermediaries' role. Section III will present a jurisdictional overview discussing intermediary liability safe harbour arrangements and highlighting issues with systemic fragmentation and miscellaneous inconsistent approaches. Mapping online intermediary liability worldwide entails the review of a wide-ranging topic, stretching into many different areas of law and domain-specific solutions. Section IV will provide an overview of intermediate liability for copyright, trademark, and privacy infringement, together with Internet platforms' obligations and liabilities for defamation, hate and dangerous speech. Section V reviews intermediary liability enforcement strategies by focusing on emerging trends, including proactive monitoring obligations across the entire spectrum of intermediary liability subject matters, blocking orders against innocent third parties, and the emergence of administrative enforcement of intermediary liability online. In addition, Section VI discusses an additional core emerging trend in intermediary liability enforcement: voluntary measures and private ordering.

Using a dataset of judicial constraints across 163 different countries from 1960 to 2000, we find that established independent judiciaries prevent regime changes toward authoritarianism across all types of states. Established courts are also capable of thwarting regime collapses in nondemocracies. These results provide some of the first large-n evidence confirming the ability of the judiciary to maintain regime stability.

Yet, the meaning of this drop for the larger legitimacy of the Court is not as clear as the poll data themselves. Some believe that dissatisfaction with the Court’s rulings threatens the institution’s legitimacy. Conventional legitimacy theory, on the other hand, posits a “reservoir of goodwill” through which the translation of dissatisfaction into lowered legitimacy is blocked. Positivity theory, with its focus on the legitimizing role of the symbols of judicial authority, provides at least a partial explanation of how legitimacy is maintained in the face of rising disappointment in the Court’s rulings.

As the theory has been pushed, a number of new controversies have emerged. Here, we identify four such debates: (a) whether the Court’s legitimacy rests on satisfaction with its performance, (b) whether support for the Supreme Court reﬂects the polarization of politics in the contemporary United States, (c) whether the Court’s legitimacy requires belief in the “myth of legality”, and (d ) whether judicial decisions can change public opinion. Our analysis of these issues generally concludes that the Supreme Court’s legitimacy is reasonably secure, in part because individual rulings have little impact on support for the institution, in part because the Court has access to powerful and inﬂuential symbols of judicial authority, and in part because the current Supreme Court issues roughly equal numbers of conservative and liberal decisions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Gibson","given":"James L."},{"family":"Nelson","given":"Michael J."}],"container-title":"Annual Review of Law and Social Science","DOI":"10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110413-030546","ISSN":"1550-3585, 1550-3631","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,11,3]]},"language":"en","page":"201-219","source":"Crossref","title":"The Legitimacy of the US Supreme Court: Conventional Wisdoms and Recent Challenges Thereto","title-short":"The Legitimacy of the US Supreme Court","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-110413-030546","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"gigliettoItTakesVillage2020","abstract":"Over the last few years, a proliferation of attempts to define, understand and fight the spread of problematic information in contemporary media ecosystems emerged. Most of these attempts focus on false content and/or bad actors detection. In this paper, we argue for a wider ecological focus. Using the frame of media manipulation and a revised version of the ‘coordinated inauthentic behavior’ original definition, the paper presents a study based on an unprecedented combination of Facebook data, accessed through the CrowdTangle API, and two datasets of Italian political news stories published in the run-up to the 2018 Italian general election and 2019 European election. By focusing on actors’ collective behavior, we identified several networks of pages, groups, and verified public profiles (‘entities’), that shared the same political news articles on Facebook within a very short period of time. Some entities in our networks were openly political, while others, despite sharing political content too, deceptively presented themselves as entertainment venues. The proportion of inauthentic entities in a network affects the wideness of the range of news media sources they shared, thus pointing to different strategies and possible motivations. The paper has both theoretical and empirical implications: it frames the concept of ‘coordinated inauthentic behavior’ in existing literature, introduces a method to detect coordinated link sharing behavior and points out different strategies and methods employed by networks of actors willing to manipulate the media and public opinion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Giglietto","given":"Fabio"},{"family":"Righetti","given":"Nicola"},{"family":"Rossi","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Marino","given":"Giada"}],"container-title":"Information, Communication & Society","DOI":"10.1080/1369118X.2020.1739732","ISSN":"1369-118X","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,17]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2020.1739732","page":"1-25","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"It takes a village to manipulate the media: coordinated link sharing behavior during 2018 and 2019 Italian elections","title-short":"It takes a village to manipulate the media","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2020.1739732","volume":"0"},

  {"id":"gilbertWhyPoliceKill2016","abstract":"Widespread awareness of the recent deaths of several black males at the hands of police has revealed an unaddressed public health challenge—determining the root causes of excessive use of force by police applied to black males that may result in “justifiable homicides.” The criminalization of black males has a long history in the USA, which has resulted in an increase in policing behaviors by legal authorities and created inequitable life chances for black males. Currently, the discipline of public health has not applied an intersectional approach that investigates the intersection of race and gender to understanding police behaviors that lead to “justifiable homicides” for black males. This article applies the core tenets and processes of Public Health Critical Race Praxis (PHCRP) to develop a framework that can improve research and interventions to address the disparities observed in recent trend analyses of “justifiable homicides.” Accordingly, we use PHCRP to offer an alternative framework on the social, legal, and health implications of violence-related incidents. We aim to move the literature in this area forward to help scholars, policymakers, and activists build the capacity of communities to address the excessive use of force by police to reduce mortality rates from “justifiable homicides.”","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Gilbert","given":"Keon L."},{"family":"Ray","given":"Rashawn"}],"container-title":"Journal of Urban Health","container-title-short":"J Urban Health","DOI":"10.1007/s11524-015-0005-x","ISSN":"1468-2869","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"122-140","source":"Springer Link","title":"Why Police Kill Black Males with Impunity: Applying Public Health Critical Race Praxis (PHCRP) to Address the Determinants of Policing Behaviors and “Justifiable” Homicides in the USA","title-short":"Why Police Kill Black Males with Impunity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11524-015-0005-x","volume":"93"},

We report on an effort to do so, using a unique data set that includes measures of the key variables for 1,779 policy issues.\nMultivariate analysis indicates that economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy, while average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little or no independent influence. The results provide substantial support for theories of Economic-Elite Domination and for theories of Biased Pluralism, but not for theories of Majoritarian Electoral Democracy or Majoritarian Pluralism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Gilens","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Page","given":"Benjamin I."}],"container-title":"Perspectives on Politics","DOI":"10.1017/S1537592714001595","ISSN":"1537-5927, 1541-0986","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,9]]},"language":"en","page":"564-581","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Testing Theories of American Politics: Elites, Interest Groups, and Average Citizens","title-short":"Testing Theories of American Politics","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/testing-theories-of-american-politics-elites-interest-groups-and-average-citizens/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B","volume":"12"},

This paper offers a theory of inherent dignity based on an account of a common humanity within which all humans might be seen as possessing inherent worth and, therefore, deserving of being recognized and respected equally as ends in themselves.

  {"id":"goelStructuralViralityOnline2015","abstract":"Viral products and ideas are intuitively understood to grow through a person-to-person diffusion process analogous to the spread of an infectious disease; however, until recently it has been prohibitively difficult to directly observe purportedly viral events, and thus to rigorously quantify or characterize their structural properties. Here we propose a formal measure of what we label “structural virality” that interpolates between two conceptual extremes: content that gains its popularity through a single, large broadcast and that which grows through multiple generations with any one individual directly responsible for only a fraction of the total adoption. We use this notion of structural virality to analyze a unique data set of a billion diffusion events on Twitter, including the propagation of news stories, videos, images, and petitions. We find that across all domains and all sizes of events, online diffusion is characterized by surprising structural diversity; that is, popular events regularly grow via both broadcast and viral mechanisms, as well as essentially all conceivable combinations of the two. Nevertheless, we find that structural virality is typically low, and remains so independent of size, suggesting that popularity is largely driven by the size of the largest broadcast. Finally, we attempt to replicate these findings with a model of contagion characterized by a low infection rate spreading on a scale-free network. We find that although several of our empirical findings are consistent with such a model, it fails to replicate the observed diversity of structural virality, thereby suggesting new directions for future modeling efforts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Goel","given":"Sharad"},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Ashton"},{"family":"Hofman","given":"Jake"},{"family":"Watts","given":"Duncan J."}],"container-title":"Management Science","container-title-short":"Management Science","DOI":"10.1287/mnsc.2015.2158","ISSN":"0025-1909, 1526-5501","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,7,22]]},"language":"en","page":"150722112809007","source":"Crossref","title":"The Structural Virality of Online Diffusion","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2158","volume":"62"},

This paper focuses on the governance of platforms that facilitate creative work—that is, complex work tasks that require high-level skill and creative workers. Crowdwork platform governance faces numerous challenges as a result of technology mediation, scalable and distributed workers, and temporary work arrangements. Creative crowdwork platforms, such as Topcoder, typically require additional governance structures to manage complex tasks. However, we know relatively little about creative crowdwork platform governance, as most existing studies focus on routine work platforms, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk. Accordingly, this paper explores how incumbent and insurgent creative crowdwork platforms are governed under centralized and decentralized modes. We conducted a comparative case study based on the analysis of two different cases: Topcoder, a successful commercial platform with a largely centralized governance structure, and CanYa, an emerging innovative platform based on blockchain technology with more decentralized governance. We identified and classified different governance elements related to work control and work coordination. In addition, we explored the characteristics of creative crowdwork platform governance with different degrees of centralization.","author":[{"family":"Gol","given":"Elham Shafiei"},{"family":"Avital","given":"Michel"},{"family":"Stein","given":"Mari-Klara"}],"language":"en","page":"17","source":"Zotero","title":"CROWDWORK PLATFORMS: JUXTAPOSING CENTRALIZED AND DECENTRALIZED GOVERNANCE","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"goluboffWonYouPlease1999","abstract":"During World War II, young African Americans from southern cities left their homes for what appeared to be patriotic job opportunities harvesting sugar cane in Florida. When returning workers described peonage and slavery instead, parents worried about their children's safety. After attempting to contact their children directly, the parents appealed to the federal government. Their decision to mobilize the federal government and the strategies they used to do so reveal important aspects of wartime African American protest that historians have previously overlooked. This article focuses on families instead of atomized individuals, revealing the importance of families, neighborhoods, and communities to the emergence of rights consciousness. It also complicates the historiographical dichotomy between rights consciousness and patronage relationships. Patrons sewed as liaisons with law enforcement agencies and provided links to a law-centered rights consciousness. For many historians, until protest exits the realm of patronage ties, it is not really protest, and once interactions with government themselves become bureaucratized they cease to be protest any longer. The efforts of the peons' families challenge both ends of this narrow category of protest; they both used patronage relations to lodge their protests and also forged rights consciousness within the legal process itself.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Goluboff","given":"Risa L."}],"container-title":"Law & Social Inquiry","container-title-short":"Law & Social Inquiry","DOI":"10.1111/j.1747-4469.1999.tb00405.x","ISSN":"0897-6546","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[1999,10,1]]},"page":"777-806","source":"onlinelibrary-wiley-com.proxy.lib.uiowa.edu (Atypon)","title":"“Won't You Please Help Me Get My Son Home”: Peonage, Patronage, and Protest in the World War II Urban South","title-short":"“Won't You Please Help Me Get My Son Home”","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1747-4469.1999.tb00405.x","volume":"24"},

This paper investigates the impact of this third strategy on the performance of Brazilian courts. We use multiple regression analysis to test an array of related hypotheses about the complex interactions between the number of judicial staff and court productivity. The empirical research uses ten-year (2003-2012) data from 27 Brazilian courts. The main findings indicate that the number of judicial assistants has a positive influence on court productivity, and the number of assistants mitigates the positive relationship between court caseload and court productivity.

  {"id":"gomez-gardenesExplosiveContagionNetworks2016","abstract":"The spread of social phenomena such as behaviors, ideas or products is an ubiquitous but remarkably complex phenomenon. A successful avenue to study the spread of social phenomena relies on epidemic models by establishing analogies between the transmission of social phenomena and infectious diseases. Such models typically assume simple social interactions restricted to pairs of individuals; effects of the context are often neglected. Here we show that local synergistic effects associated with acquaintances of pairs of individuals can have striking consequences on the spread of social phenomena at large scales. The most interesting predictions are found for a scenario in which the contagion ability of a spreader decreases with the number of ignorant individuals surrounding the target ignorant. This mechanism mimics ubiquitous situations in which the willingness of individuals to adopt a new product depends not only on the intrinsic value of the product but also on whether his acquaintances will adopt this product or not. In these situations, we show that the typically smooth (second order) transitions towards large social contagion become explosive (first order). The proposed synergistic mechanisms therefore explain why ideas, rumours or products can suddenly and sometimes unexpectedly catch on.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Gómez-Gardeñes","given":"J."},{"family":"Lotero","given":"L."},{"family":"Taraskin","given":"S.

To that end, a comprehensive Student Evaluation of Teaching (SET) instrument is proposed, which includes not only conventional teaching elements, but also items that encourage twenty-first century skills. The goal of the study is twofold: (i) to quantify the extent to which the selected variables explain the IOP rating, and (ii) determine which teaching and non-teaching variables most affect the IOP rating. The best performing classifier achieved a competitive accuracy, highlighting that the selected variables mainly determine the IOP values. Other important findings include: (i) the IOP value is mainly influenced by the effectiveness of the instructor in his/her teaching roles; (ii) teaching strategies that involve the cooperation between the technical and pedagogical roles should be promoted; (iii) the pedagogical role has the highest impact on the final IOP value; and (iv) the most influential demographic variable is the student’s status (working commitments and family responsibilities).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Gómez-Rey","given":"Pilar"},{"family":"Fernández-Navarro","given":"Francisco"},{"family":"Barbera","given":"Elena"},{"family":"Carbonero-Ruz","given":"Mariano"}],"container-title":"Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education","DOI":"10.1080/02602938.2018.1451483","ISSN":"0260-2938","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,17]]},"page":"1272-1285","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Understanding student evaluations of teaching in online learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/02602938.2018.1451483","volume":"43"},
  {"id":"gonawelaSpeakingTheirMind2018","abstract":"The authors in this study examined the function and public reception of critical tweeting in online campaigns of four nationalist populist politicians during major national election campaigns. Using a mix of qualitative coding and case study inductive methods, we analyzed the tweets of Narendra Modi, Nigel Farage, Donald Trump, and Geert Wilders before the 2014 Indian general elections, the 2016 UK Brexit referendum, the 2016 US presidential election, and the 2017 Dutch general election, respectively. Our data show that Trump is a consistent outlier in terms of using critical language on Twitter when compared to Wilders, Farage, and Modi, but that all four leaders show signiﬁcant investment in various forms of antagonistic messaging including personal insults, sarcasm, and labeling, and that these are rewarded online by higher retweet rates. Building on the work of Murray Edelman and his notion of a political spectacle, we examined Twitter as a performative space for critical rhetoric within the frame of nationalist politics. We found that cultural and political differences among the four settings also impact how each politician employs these tactics. Our work proposes that studies of social media spaces need to bring normative questions into traditional notions of collaboration. As we show here, political actors may beneﬁt from in-group coalescence around antagonistic messaging, which while serving as a call to arms for online collaboration for those ideologically aligned, may on a societal level lead to greater polarization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,12,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Gonawela","given":"A’ndre"},{"family":"Pal","given":"Joyojeet"},{"family":"Thawani","given":"Udit"},{"family":"Vlugt","given":"Elmer","non-dropping-particle":"van der"},{"family":"Out","given":"Wim"},{"family":"Chandra","given":"Priyank"}],"container-title":"Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)","DOI":"10.1007/s10606-018-9316-2","ISSN":"0925-9724, 1573-7551","issue":"3-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,12]]},"language":"en","page":"293-326","source":"Crossref","title":"Speaking their Mind: Populist Style and Antagonistic Messaging in the Tweets of Donald Trump, Narendra Modi, Nigel Farage, and Geert Wilders","title-short":"Speaking their Mind","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10606-018-9316-2","volume":"27"},

With legislative fixes for the United States’ immigration system unlikely in the near future, the Obama Administration will continue to press its immigration agenda via executive order and enforcement memorandum. Such initiatives do provide real short-term benefits, but they are by nature temporary and lack the ability to provide any permanent status to their beneficiaries.

This article thus seeks to (a) contextualize the recent implementation of transparency as enacted by platform companies with an overview of the ample relevant literature on digital transparency in both theory and practice; (b) consider the potential positive governance impacts of transparency as a form of accountability in the current political moment; and (c) reﬂect upon the potential shortfalls of transparency that should be considered by legislators, academics, and funding bodies weighing the relative beneﬁts of policy or research dealing with transparency in this area.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Gorwa","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Ash","given":"Timothy Garton"}],"DOI":"10.31235/osf.io/ehcy2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,4]]},"language":"en","note":"preprint doi: 10.31235/osf.io/ehcy2","publisher":"SocArXiv","source":"DataCite","title":"Democratic Transparency in the Platform Society","type":"chapter","URL":"https://osf.io/ehcy2"},
  {"id":"gorwaPlatformGovernanceTriangle2019","abstract":"From the new Facebook ‘Oversight Body’ for content moderation to the ‘Christchurch Call to eliminate terrorism and violent extremism online,’ a growing number of voluntary and non-binding informal governance initiatives have recently been proposed as attractive ways to rein in Facebook, Google, and other platform companies hosting user-generated content. Drawing on the literature on transnational corporate governance, this article reviews a number of informal arrangements governing online content on platforms in Europe, mapping them onto Abbott and Snidal’s (2009) ‘governance triangle’ model. I discuss three key dynamics shaping the success of informal governance arrangements: actor competencies, ‘legitimation politics,’ and inter-actor relationships of power and coercion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Gorwa","given":"Robert"}],"DOI":"10.31235/osf.io/tgnrj","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,26]]},"language":"en","source":"DataCite","title":"The platform governance triangle: conceptualising the informal regulation of online content","title-short":"The platform governance triangle","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://osf.io/tgnrj"},
  {"id":"gorwaWhatPlatformGovernance2019","abstract":"Following a host of high-profile scandals, the political influence of platform companies (the global corporations that that operate online ‘platforms’ such as Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, and many other online services) is slowly being re-evaluated. Amidst growing calls to regulate these companies and make them more democratically accountable, and a host of policy interventions that are actively being pursued in Europe and beyond, a better understanding of how platform practices, policies, and affordances (in effect, how platforms govern) interact with the external political forces trying to shape those practices and policies is needed. Building on digital media and communication scholarship as well as governance literature from political science and international relations, the aim of this article is to map an interdisciplinary research agenda for platform governance, a concept intended to capture the layers of governance relationships structuring interactions between key parties in today's platform society, including platform companies, users, advertisers, governments, and other political actors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Gorwa","given":"Robert"}],"container-title":"Information, Communication & Society","DOI":"10.1080/1369118X.2019.1573914","ISSN":"1369-118X","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,12]]},"language":"en","page":"854-871","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"What is platform governance?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2019.1573914","volume":"22"},
  {"id":"gostinPoliticsPublicHealth2003","abstract":"Conservatives are taking aim at the field of public health, targeting its efforts to understand and control environmental and social causes of disease. Richard Epstein and others contend that these efforts in fact undermine people’s health and well-being by eroding people’s incentives to create economic value. Public health, they argue, should stick to its traditional task—the struggle against infectious diseases. Because markets are not up to the task of controlling the transmission of infectious disease, Epstein says, coercive government action is required. But market incentives, not state action, he asserts, represent our best hope for controlling the chronic illnesses that are the main causes of death in industrialized nations. In this article, we assess Epstein’s case.We consider his claims about the market’s capabilities and limits, the roles of personal choice and social influences in spreading disease, and the relationship between health and economic inequality.We argue that Epstein’s critique of public health overreaches, oversimplifies, and veils his political and moral preferences behind seemingly objective claims about the economics of disease control and the determinants of disease spread. Public health policy requires political and moral choices, but these choices should be transparent.","author":[{"family":"Gostin","given":"Lawrence O"},{"family":"Bloche","given":"Maxwell Gregg"}],"issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003]]},"language":"en","page":"17","source":"Zotero","title":"The Politics of Public Health: A Response to Epstein","type":"article-journal","volume":"46"},

  {"id":"gourevitchWelcomeDarkSide2014","abstract":"ABSTRACTJohn Tomasi's Free Market Fairness claims to provide a principled defense of classical-liberal institutions. Respect for the development of our moral powers or “self-authorship,” according to Tomasi, requires that we make certain economic liberties basic, including freedom of contract and the right to accumulate property. Yet Tomasi's principles and his institutions are at odds. Tomasi has provided ethical grounds for defending not classical-liberal but radical-democratic, even socialist, economic freedoms. This is most vivid in Tomasi's account of the “liberties of working.” He argues that it is not just the choice of work but control of the workplace experience that is a vital part of our self-authorship. If this is true, Tomasi has not given a defense of a robust right to “freedom of contract,” but rather of those rights of control over work and property that leftists have long argued for.","author":[{"family":"Gourevitch","given":"Alex"}],"container-title":"Critical Review","container-title-short":"Critical Review","DOI":"10.1080/08913811.2014.947743","issue":"3-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"page":"290-305","title":"Welcome to the Dark Side: A Classical-Liberal Argument for Economic Democracy","title-short":"Welcome to the Dark Side: A Classical-Liberal Argument for Economic Democracy","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08913811.2014.947743","volume":"26"},

Given algorithmic systems’ impact and sometimes harm on people’s everyday life, information access and agency, awareness of algorithms has the potential to be a critical issue. We, therefore, ask whether having awareness of algorithms or not corresponds to a new reinforced digital divide. This study examines levels of awareness and attitudes toward algorithms across the population of the highly digitized country of Norway. Our exploratory research finds clear demographic differences regarding levels of algorithms awareness. Furthermore, attitudes to algorithm driven recommendations (e.g., YouTube and Spotify), advertisements and content (e.g., personalized news feeds in social media and online newspaper) are associated with both the level of algorithm awareness and demographic variables. A cluster analysis facilitates an algorithm awareness typology of six groups: the unaware, the uncertain, the affirmative, the neutral, the sceptic and the critical.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Gran","given":"Anne-Britt"},{"family":"Booth","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Bucher","given":"Taina"}],"container-title":"Information, Communication & Society","DOI":"10.1080/1369118X.2020.1736124","ISSN":"1369-118X","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,9]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2020.1736124","page":"1-18","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"To be or not to be algorithm aware: a question of a new digital divide?","title-short":"To be or not to be algorithm aware","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2020.1736124","volume":"0"},
  {"id":"grantDignityEquality2007","abstract":"Inequality remains one of the most challenging issues on the global human rights agenda. It is widely recognised that a formal approach to the assessment of inequality has failed to eliminate entrenched structural social and economic inequality and that a different approach is required in order to tackle the roots of inequality and achieve substantive equality. In seeking to implement an approach to equality that addresses the history of apartheid and the social and economic inequality endemic in South African society, the South African Constitutional Court has rejected formal equality, and is in the process of developing a substantive interpretation of equality based on the protection of human dignity. Critics of this approach have argued that the concept of human dignity is too indeterminate to provide a stable foundation for equality law and that it promotes an excessively individualistic conception of equality. Focussing on key developments in defining human dignity in German and South African constitutional law, this article argues that the concept of dignity is rooted in a rich tradition which is capable of underpinning an approach to equality which avoids excessive individualism and fully recognises the interplay between individual and community needs. A detailed exploration of the equality jurisprudence of the South African Constitutional Court reveals how the dignity-based approach has been developed in order to provide a framework within which the actual experience of victims of discrimination can be explored. It is concluded that this approach has the potential to engage with the realities of the wide range of divisions within South African society and their effects in order to address not only the legacy of apartheid but also to contribute to the creation of a society in which every person is valued equally.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Grant","given":"E."}],"container-title":"Human Rights Law Review","DOI":"10.1093/hrlr/ngm002","ISSN":"1461-7781, 1744-1021","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,3,27]]},"language":"en","page":"299-329","source":"Crossref","title":"Dignity and Equality","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/hrlr/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/hrlr/ngm002","volume":"7"},

Prompted by the unsettling effects associated with the ‘fake news’ scandal, we propose methodological tactics for exploring (1) the link economy and the ranking of content, (2) the like economy and the metrification of engagement and (3) the tracker economy and the commodification of attention. Rather than focusing on the misleading content of junk news, such tactics surface the infrastructural conditions of their circulation, enabling public interventions and experiments to interrogate, challenge and change their role in reconfiguring relations between different aspects of social, cultural, economic and political life.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Gray","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Bounegru","given":"Liliana"},{"family":"Venturini","given":"Tommaso"}],"container-title":"New Media & Society","container-title-short":"New Media & Society","DOI":"10.1177/1461444819856912","ISSN":"1461-4448","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"317-341","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"‘Fake news’ as infrastructural uncanny","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444819856912","volume":"22"},
  {"id":"grayPlayingMachinesUsing2020","abstract":"This article presents the results of methodological experimentation that utilises machine learning to investigate automated copyright enforcement on YouTube. Using a dataset of 76.7 million YouTube videos, we explore how digital and computational methods can be leveraged to better understand content moderation and copyright enforcement at a large scale.We used the BERT language model to train a machine learning classifier to identify videos in categories that reflect ongoing controversies in copyright takedowns. We use this to explore, in a granular way, how copyright is enforced on YouTube, using both statistical methods and qualitative analysis of our categorised dataset. We provide a large-scale systematic analysis of removals rates from Content ID’s automated detection system and the largely automated, text search based, Digital Millennium Copyright Act notice and takedown system.

  {"id":"graysonRepeatedLowTeaching2015","abstract":"Teaching evaluations have become part of life on Canadian campuses; however, there is no agreement among researchers as to their validity. In this article, comparisons were made between first- and third-year collective evaluations of professors' performance at the University of British Columbia, York University, and McGill University. Overall, it was found that students who provided low evaluations in their first year were also likely to do so in their third year. This effect held independent of degree of campus engagement, sex, student status (domestic or international), and generational status (students who were the first in their families to attend university, compared to those who were not). Given that over the course of their studies, students likely would have been exposed to a range of different behaviours on the part of their professors, it is argued that the propensity of a large number of students to give consistently low evaluations was a form of \"habitual behaviour.\"","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Grayson","given":"J.

  {"id":"greenDisparateInteractionsAlgorithmintheLoop2019","abstract":"Despite vigorous debates about the technical characteristics of risk assessments being deployed in the U.S. criminal justice system, remarkably little research has studied how these tools affect actual decision-making processes. After all, risk assessments do not make definitive decisions---they inform judges, who are the final arbiters. It is therefore essential that considerations of risk assessments be informed by rigorous studies of how judges actually interpret and use them. This paper takes a first step toward such research on human interactions with risk assessments through a controlled experimental study on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We found several behaviors that call into question the supposed efficacy and fairness of risk assessments: our study participants 1) underperformed the risk assessment even when presented with its predictions, 2) could not effectively evaluate the accuracy of their own or the risk assessment's predictions, and 3) exhibited behaviors fraught with \"disparate interactions,\" whereby the use of risk assessments led to higher risk predictions about black defendants and lower risk predictions about white defendants. These results suggest the need for a new \"algorithm-in-the-loop\" framework that places machine learning decision-making aids into the sociotechnical context of improving human decisions rather than the technical context of generating the best prediction in the abstract. If risk assessments are to be used at all, they must be grounded in rigorous evaluations of their real-world impacts instead of in their theoretical potential.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Green","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Yiling"}],"collection-title":"FAT* '19","container-title":"Proceedings of the Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency","DOI":"10.1145/3287560.3287563","event-place":"Atlanta, GA, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-6125-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,29]]},"page":"90–99","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"Atlanta, GA, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Disparate Interactions: An Algorithm-in-the-Loop Analysis of Fairness in Risk Assessments","title-short":"Disparate Interactions","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://doi.org/10.1145/3287560.3287563"},

  {"id":"greeneTHEORYPOVERTYLEGAL","abstract":"The puzzle of why the cycle of poverty persists and upward socioeconomic mobility is so difficult has long captivated scholars and the public alike. Yet with all of the attention that has been paid to poverty, the crucial role of the law, particularly state and local law, in perpetuating poverty is largely ignored. This Article offers a new theory of poverty, one that introduces the concept of legal immobility. Legal immobility considers the cumulative effects of state and local laws as a mechanism through which poverty is perpetuated and upward socioeconomic mobility is stunted. The Article provides an initial description and normative account of this undertheorized aspect of our laws and argues that in order to fully understand poverty, a more complete understanding of the relationship between law and poverty is needed. After discussing several examples of laws that can contribute to legal immobility (everything from state and local tax laws to occupational licensing laws), the Article offers a three-prong theory to help understand the distinct pathways through which individual laws that contribute to legal immobility function: (1) calculated exploitation; (2) gratuitous management; and (3) routine neglect. This framework provides a guide for future work to build on legal immobility theory. By bringing to light the cumulative effects of local and state laws in perpetuating poverty, the goal is for legal immobility theory to ultimately help lawmakers develop new structural approaches to tackling poverty.","author":[{"family":"Greene","given":"Sara S"}],"language":"en","page":"49","source":"Zotero","title":"A THEORY OF POVERTY: LEGAL IMMOBILITY","type":"article-journal","volume":"96"},

Cognitive rules are social constructs that convey information that distills and summarizes society's beliefs and experience.

We describe the characteristics of such rules in the context of a market for ideas, and illustrate their importance in two developments central to the growth of modern economies: the rise of the modern state with its legitimacy based on consent, and the rise of modern science-based technology that was the product of the scientific revolution and the Enlightenment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Greif","given":"Avner"},{"family":"Mokyr","given":"Joel"}],"container-title":"Journal of Institutional Economics","DOI":"10.1017/S1744137416000370","ISSN":"1744-1374, 1744-1382","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,3]]},"language":"en","page":"25-52","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Cognitive rules, institutions, and economic growth: Douglass North and beyond","title-short":"Cognitive rules, institutions, and economic growth","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-institutional-economics/article/cognitive-rules-institutions-and-economic-growth-douglass-north-and-beyond/9246B44AE24CF2BDFC88BA7A6A0E2E4E","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"greifEndogenousPoliticalLegitimacy","abstract":"This paper opens the ‘black box’ of political legitimacy and asks what role, if any, it played in the transformation of pre-modern England’s political system to one based on representation and the rule of law. Accordingly, the paper …rst presents a theory of endogenous legitimacy and why it in‡uences the distribution of political power and thus policies, institutions, and outcomes. Applying this framework to England’s political history highlights the importance of the Reformation, following which the Catholic Church lost its legitimizing role. The Crown’s increasing reliance on Parliament and the laws it produced for legitimation changed the balance of political power in favor of Parliament. Legitimacy was thus central to the 17th-century Civil War and the Glorious Revolution, as the Stuart monarchs attempted to undermine the legitimizing role –and hence power –of Parliament. The analysis lends support to the view that institutions and culture are inter-related.","author":[{"family":"Greif","given":"Avner"}],"language":"en","page":"44","source":"Zotero","title":"Endogenous Political Legitimacy: The English Reformation and the Institutional Foundations of Limited Government","type":"article-journal"},

The authors entered students' Rotter scale scores derived from the standard instrument used to measure locus of control orientation into an empirical ordered probit model estimated to explain the determination of student evaluation of teaching scores.

Differing forms of active, passive, and uncivil social media were taken into account and the findings suggest active social media use for politics was actually related to less support for Republican populists, such as Trump, but that forms of both passive or uncivil social media use were linked to an increase in the likelihood of support to a level roughly equivalent to that of the traditional television viewing.

  {"id":"groverPolarizationAcculturationUS2019","abstract":"Elections are among the most critical events in a national calendar. During elections, candidates increasingly use social media platforms to engage voters. Using the 2016 US presidential election as a case study, we looked at the use of Twitter by political campaigns and examined how the drivers of voter behaviour were reflected in Twitter. Social media analytics have been used to derive insights related to theoretical frameworks within political science. Using social media analytics, we investigated whether the nature of social media discussions have an impact on voting behaviour during an election, through acculturation of ideologies and polarization of voter preferences. Our findings indicate that discussions on Twitter could have polarized users significantly. Reasons behind such polarization were explored using Newman and Sheth's model of voter's choice behaviour. Geographical analysis of tweets, users, and campaigns suggests acculturation of ideologies among voting groups. Finally, network analysis among voters indicates that polarization may have occurred due to differences between the respective online campaigns. This study thus provides important and highly relevant insights into voter behaviour for the future management and governance of successful political campaigns.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Grover","given":"Purva"},{"family":"Kar","given":"Arpan Kumar"},{"family":"Dwivedi","given":"Yogesh K."},{"family":"Janssen","given":"Marijn"}],"container-title":"Technological Forecasting and Social Change","container-title-short":"Technological Forecasting and Social Change","DOI":"10.1016/j.techfore.2018.09.009","ISSN":"0040-1625","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"438-460","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Polarization and acculturation in US Election 2016 outcomes – Can twitter analytics predict changes in voting preferences","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004016251731421X","volume":"145"},

Both Elinor Ostrom and Jane Jacobs have explored how a community’s capacity for self-governance affects its ability to solve complex problems (for example, dealing with crime, the provision of public goods, or problems of neighborhood blight). The greater a community’s capacity for self-governance the better able it is to deal with these complex challenges. This paper examines how pre-disaster systems of self-governance aid in post-disaster community recovery. Our analysis focuses on the Mary Queen of Vietnam (MQVN) community and Gentilly, examines the effectiveness of their systems of self-governance prior to Hurricane Katrina and explores the role these systems played in promoting community recovery after the disaster.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Grube","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Storr","given":"Virgil Henry"}],"container-title":"The Review of Austrian Economics","container-title-short":"Rev Austrian Econ","DOI":"10.1007/s11138-013-0210-3","ISSN":"1573-7128","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"301-324","source":"Springer Link","title":"The capacity for self-governance and post-disaster resiliency","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11138-013-0210-3","volume":"27"},

This question has been largely unexamined empirically. We addressed this issue by examining the role of emotional response and video source on the likelihood of spreading an Internet video by validating the emotional response to an Internet video and investigating the underlying mechanisms. Results indicated that individuals reporting strong affective responses to a video reported greater intent to spread the video. In terms of the role of the source, anger-producing videos were more likely to be forwarded but only when the source of the video was an out-group member.

Given the potential for widespread dissemination of this material, we examine the individual-level characteristics associated with sharing false articles during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. To do so, we uniquely link an original survey with respondents’ sharing activity as recorded in Facebook profile data. First and foremost, we find that sharing this content was a relatively rare activity. Conservatives were more likely to share articles from fake news domains, which in 2016 were largely pro-Trump in orientation, than liberals or moderates. We also find a strong age effect, which persists after controlling for partisanship and ideology: On average, users over 65 shared nearly seven times as many articles from fake news domains as the youngest age group.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Guess","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Nagler","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Tucker","given":"Joshua"}],"container-title":"Science Advances","DOI":"10.1126/sciadv.aau4586","ISSN":"2375-2548","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,1]]},"language":"en","source":"advances.sciencemag.org","title":"Less than you think: Prevalence and predictors of fake news dissemination on Facebook","title-short":"Less than you think","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/1/eaau4586","volume":"5"},

Research on why misinformation continues to influence reasoning has primarily focused on narrow timeframes in controlled laboratory settings. We advance the study of why rumors persist—even after valid corrections have been presented—by leveraging a unique collection of Twitter data covering four specific political events, including the Boston Marathon bombing and the death of Antonin Scalia. Combining these large datasets with machine learning techniques, we show how “corrective” information (such as the capture of suspects) affects the transmission of rumors up to 10 days after the incidents occurred. In several cases, we show that Twitter users estimated to be conservative are more likely to continue spreading rumors even after such causal explanations have been provided by public authorities. Furthermore, many of the rumors originate with a small number of conspiracy-oriented websites. We discuss cognitive mechanisms underpinning these findings such as motivated reasoning and the impact of the correction’s source credibility.

  {"id":"gulottyNarrowingChannel2020","abstract":"While large, multinational corporations have supported the removal of tariffs, behind the scenes these firms have fought for protection in the form of product regulations, including testing, labeling, and registration requirements. Unlike tariffs, these regulations can raise fixed costs, excluding smaller firms from the market and shifting profits toward global giants.Narrowing the Channel demonstrates that globalization and globalized firms can paradoxically hinder rather than foster economic cooperation as larger firms seek to protect their markets through often unnecessarily strict product regulations. To illustrate the problem of regulatory protectionism, Robert Gulotty offers an in-depth analysis of contemporary rulemaking in the United States and the European Union in the areas of health, safety, and environmental standards. He shows how large firms seek regulatory schemes that disproportionately disadvantage small firms. When multinationals are embedded in the local economy, governments too have an incentive to use these regulations to shift profits back home. Today, the key challenge to governing global trade is not how much trade occurs but who is allowed to participate, and this book shows that new rules will be needed to allow governments to widen the benefits of global commerce and avoid further inequality and market concentration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Gulotty","given":"Robert"}],"ISBN":"978-0-226-66936-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"publisher":"University of Chicago Press","source":"press.uchicago.edu","title":"Narrowing the Channel","type":"book","URL":"https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/N/bo45084644.html"},

  {"id":"gunitskyDigitalAuthoritarianismStill","abstract":"I outline four strategies used by nondemocratic regimes to deal with threats posed by internet technology: blocking, filtering, co-opting, and flooding. Strategies of blocking and filtering rely on suppressing flows of information, and are thus easily identifiable with nondemocratic regimes. However, the more recent strategies of co-option and, in particular, flooding, rely not on hindering information flows but on facilitating them – even while the information itself is false, distracting, or otherwise worthless. Flooding lives comfortably inside democracies, is easily generated by domestic actors, and is compatible with democratic norms. The same free flows of information that make the disruption of democracy by censorship impossible also make the disruption of democracy by flooding easier. As a result, the distinction between digital autocracy and digital democracy is increasingly untenable. The distinction may even be harmful because it falsely emphasizes foreign threats that seek to undermine democracy from without. In fact, the real threat is largely from within.","author":[{"family":"Gunitsky","given":"Seva"}],"language":"en","page":"5","source":"Zotero","title":"Is Digital Authoritarianism Still a Useful Concept?","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"gussenProblemScaleHayek2013","abstract":"There is no shortage of crises in the ecological (e.g. climate change), economic (e.g. the Global Financial Crisis), and socio-political spheres (e.g. the Arab Spring). While such crises are not new to the human saga, both the magnitude and frequency of these crises seem to be intensifying. The usual prognosis follows the public/private dichotomy, suggesting more or less government intervention (and the closely related variants of more integration and regime change). However, there are ‘islands’ of alternative analyses where crises result from scale distortion (organisational structures of states, markets and firms that are too large or too small) and scale entanglement (strong rather than weak ties between different scales such as the local, national and global). This paper attempts to synthesise this scale problematisation into one coherent school of thought. To this end, we introduce the complexity ansatz, which links complexity to symmetry (breaking), scale and collapse. To illustrate, the paper traces this ansatz in the writings of Friedrich Hayek, Léopold Kohr and Jane Jacobs (HKJ). The thesis is that the moribund nation state needs to be relegated to a subsidiary role to evade collapse. Loosely coupled (fiscally and monetarily) autonomous city-regions should be the ‘eyes’ of socio-economic action.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Gussen","given":"Benjamen F."}],"container-title":"Constitutional Political Economy","container-title-short":"Const Polit Econ","DOI":"10.1007/s10602-012-9130-7","ISSN":"1572-9966","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"19-42","source":"Springer Link","title":"On the problem of scale: Hayek, Kohr, Jacobs and the reinvention of the political state","title-short":"On the problem of scale","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10602-012-9130-7","volume":"24"},

It is enforced through rules and practices that include real-name policies, Terms of Service requiring users to present only accurate information about themselves, community guidelines that prohibit “coordinated inauthentic behavior,” verification practices, product features, and more. What accounts for the rise of authenticity? This Article critically examines authenticity regulation by the social media industry, including companies’ claims that authenticity is a moral virtue, an expressive value, and a pragmatic necessity. It explains how companies engaged in “information capitalism,” “data capitalism,” and “surveillance capitalism” derive economic value from authenticity regulation. It also explores how a regulatory focus on authenticity shapes our views about objectionable speech, upends traditional commitments to pseudonymous political expression, and encourages collaboration between the State and private companies. The Article concludes that “authenticity,” as conceptualized by the industry, is not an important value on par with privacy or dignity, but that it offers business value and many of the same opportunities for viewpoint discrimination that garden-variety content moderation does.","author":[{"family":"Haan","given":"Sarah C"}],"language":"en","page":"58","source":"Zotero","title":"BAD ACTORS: AUTHENTICITY, INAUTHENTICITY, SPEECH, AND CAPITALISM","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"habermasHumanRightsPopular1994","abstract":"Popular sovereignty and human rights are the modern pillars of legal legitimacy and political power. Liberal and republican thought, however, tend to interpret the two notions from different perspectives: either as moral principles, emphasizing the self-legislation and autonomy of individuals, or as ethical values, stressing the self-realization of the political community. Adhering to his theory of communicative action, the author brings the two principles together in a non-competitive relation. Here the connection between popular sovereignty and human rights is given by the procedures of a discursive process of opinion- and will-formation. Theoretically, the institutionalization of this process through law leads to a normative model of contemporary democracy, which is based on the substance of human rights as a formal condition for deliberative politics.**","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Habermas","given":"Jürgen"}],"container-title":"Ratio Juris","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-9337.1994.tb00162.x","ISSN":"1467-9337","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1994,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1-13","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Human Rights and Popular Sovereignty: The Liberal and Republican Versions*","title-short":"Human Rights and Popular Sovereignty","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9337.1994.tb00162.x","volume":"7"},

However, labeling the training data for real-world applications is difficult, expensive, or time consuming, as it requires the effort of human annotators sometimes with specific domain experience and training. There are implicit costs associated with obtaining these labels from domain experts, such as limited time and financial resources. This is especially true for applications that involve learning with large number of class labels and sometimes with similarities among them. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) addresses this inherent bottleneck by allowing the model to integrate part or all of the available unlabeled data in its supervised learning. The goal is to maximize the learning performance of the model through such newly-labeled examples while minimizing the work required of human annotators. Exploiting unlabeled data to help improve the learning performance has become a hot topic during the last decade and it is divided into four main directions: SSL with graphs, SSL with generative models, semi-supervised support vector machines and SSL by disagreement (SSL with committees). This survey article provides an overview to research advances in this branch of machine learning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Hady","given":"Mohamed Farouk Abdel"},{"family":"Schwenker","given":"Friedhelm"}],"collection-title":"Intelligent Systems Reference Library","container-title":"Handbook on Neural Information Processing","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-642-36657-4_7","editor":[{"family":"Bianchini","given":"Monica"},{"family":"Maggini","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Jain","given":"Lakhmi","suffix":"C"}],"ISBN":"978-3-642-36656-7 978-3-642-36657-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"en","page":"215-239","publisher":"Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg","source":"link-springer-com.proxy.lib.uiowa.edu","title":"Semi-supervised Learning","type":"chapter","URL":"http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-36657-4_7"},

In their effort to become more legitimate and effective, these bodies have adopted a wide array of reforms aimed at promoting transparency. Using a unique data set on all investor—state arbitrations under the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, we show that those reforms are, in part, failing because parties have found ways to use pre-judgment settlement to hide procedural and substantive outcomes. We also show, statistically, that the parties to disputes favour less transparent outcomes where strong political pressures lead governments to violate legal norms—such as when disputes involve long-lived capital assets whose ongoing operation requires politically messy deals that neither side would like exposed to public scrutiny.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Hafner-Burton","given":"Emilie M."},{"family":"Victor","given":"David G."}],"container-title":"Journal of International Dispute Settlement","DOI":"10.1093/jnlids/idw001","ISSN":"2040-3585, 2040-3593","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,2,3]]},"language":"en","page":"idw001","source":"Crossref","title":"Secrecy in International Investment Arbitration: An Empirical Analysis","title-short":"Secrecy in International Investment Arbitration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/jids/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/jnlids/idw001"},

A meta-analysis of 83 studies tested the effect of ego depletion on task performance and related outcomes, alternative explanations and moderators of the effect, and additional strength model hypotheses. Results revealed a significant effect of ego depletion on self-control task performance. Significant effect sizes were found for ego depletion on effort, perceived difficulty, negative affect, subjective fatigue, and blood glucose levels. Small, nonsignificant effects were found for positive affect and self-efficacy. Moderator analyses indicated minimal variation in the effect across sphere of depleting and dependent task, frequently used depleting and dependent tasks, presentation of tasks as single or separate experiments, type of dependent measure and control condition task, and source laboratory. The effect size was moderated by depleting task duration, task presentation by the same or different experimenters, intertask interim period, dependent task complexity, and use of dependent tasks in the choice and volition and cognitive spheres. Motivational incentives, training on self-control tasks, and glucose supplementation promoted better self-control in ego-depleted samples. Expecting further acts of self-control exacerbated the effect. Findings provide preliminary support for the ego-depletion effect and strength model hypotheses. Support for motivation and fatigue as alternative explanations for ego depletion indicate a need to integrate the strength model with other theories. Findings provide impetus for future investigation testing additional hypotheses and mechanisms of the ego-depletion effect.

By using validated voting data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study for several recent elections, we are able to offer a more definitive test. The analysis shows that strict identification laws have a differentially negative impact on the turnout of racial and ethnic minorities in primaries and general elections.

The Facebook emotional contagion study, in which researchers altered Facebook News Feeds to determine whether exposure to emotional content influences a user’s mood, has been one focal point of these discussions. The intense negative reaction by the media and public came as a surprise to those involved—but what prompted this reaction? We approach the Facebook study as a mediated controversy that reveals disconnects between how scholars, technologists, and the public understand platform-based research. We examine the controversy from the bottom up, analyzing public reactions expressed in comments on news articles. Our analysis reveals fundamental disagreements about what Facebook is and what a user’s relationship to it should be. We argue that these divergent responses emphasize the contextual nature of technology and research ethics, and conclude with a relational and contextual approach to ethical decision-making.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Hallinan","given":"Blake"},{"family":"Brubaker","given":"Jed R"},{"family":"Fiesler","given":"Casey"}],"container-title":"New Media & Society","container-title-short":"New Media & Society","DOI":"10.1177/1461444819876944","ISSN":"1461-4448","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,23]]},"language":"en","page":"1-19","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Unexpected expectations: Public reaction to the Facebook emotional contagion study","title-short":"Unexpected expectations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444819876944"},

Study 1 used the Longitudinal Study of American Youth (N = 2774), which is a national probability sample of Generation X, to test displacement over a three-year time period. Latent change scores were used to test associations among social media adoption in 2009, social media use in 2011, direct contact frequency across years, in relation to change in well-being. Although social media adoption in 2009 predicted less social contact in 2011, increased social media use between 2009 and 2011 positively predicted well-being. Study 2 used experience sampling with a combined community and undergraduate sample (N = 116). Participants reported on their social interactions and passive social media use (i.e., excluding chat via social media) five times a day over five days. Results indicate that social media use at prior times of day was not associated with future social interaction with close others or with future face-to-face interaction. Passive social media use at prior times predicted lower future well-being only when alone at prior times. Neither study supported the social displacement hypothesis.

Although communication scholars and psychologists contributed almost half of all the articles on the topic of fake news and misinformation in the past 10 years, the wide variety of journals from various disciplines publishing the topic shows that it has captured interest from the scholarly community in general. Male scholars outnumbered female scholars in both productivity and citations on the topic, but there are variations by fields. There are very few scholars who have produced a large body of work on the topic yet. Effects of fake news/misinformation is the most common topic found in journal articles.

  {"id":"hameleersItUsThem2017","abstract":"Populism has gained momentum all around the globe. Social media channels contribute to the success of populism by providing an attractive environment for both politicians and ordinary citizens to disseminate their political ideas. Building on previous research, this study argues that attributing blame to culprit others, such as immigrants or the political elites, for causing major societal problems facing the ordinary people is central to populism. By employing a 2 × 2 between-subjects comparative survey experiment, we investigated the effects of these blame attributions in populist online messages on citizens’ exclusionist and anti-establishment populist attitudes in two Western European countries, Austria and the Netherlands (N = 646). Additionally, for the first time in extant research, we distinguished between populist politicians and ordinary citizens as communicators of populist messages. Results revealed that messages blaming the elites or immigrants bolstered citizens’ populist attitudes, but only for those who supported the source of the message. For those who opposed the source, in contrast, populist blame attributions reduced populist attitudes. These findings help us to understand how the core element of pervasive populist messages – attributing blame – affects the populist attitudes of which citizens.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Hameleers","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Schmuck","given":"Desirée"}],"container-title":"Information, Communication & Society","DOI":"10.1080/1369118X.2017.1328523","ISSN":"1369-118X, 1468-4462","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,2]]},"language":"en","page":"1425-1444","source":"Crossref","title":"It’s us against them: a comparative experiment on the effects of populist messages communicated via social media","title-short":"It’s us against them","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369118X.2017.1328523","volume":"20"},
  {"id":"hameleersMisinformationPolarizationHighChoice2019","abstract":"One of the most fundamental changes in today’s political information environment is an increasing lack of communicative truthfulness. To explore this worrisome phenomenon, this study aims to investigate the effects of political misinformation by integrating three theoretical approaches: (1) misinformation, (2) polarization, and (3) selective exposure. In this article, we examine the role of fact-checkers in discrediting polarized misinformation in a fragmented media environment. We rely on two experiments (N = 1,117) in which we vary exposure to attitudinal-congruent or incongruent political news and a follow-up fact-check article debunking the information. Participants were either forced to see or free to select a fact-checker. Results show that fact-checkers can be successful as they (1) lower agreement with attitudinally congruent political misinformation and (2) can overcome political polarization. Moreover, dependent on the issue, fact-checkers are most likely to be selected when they confirm prior attitudes and avoided when they are incongruent, indicating a confirmation bias for selecting corrective information. The freedom to select or avoid fact-checkers does not have an impact on political beliefs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Hameleers","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Meer","given":"Toni G.

Because (partisan) attributions of dishonesty and inaccuracy may influence citizens’ political opinions, and because accusations of fake news can be used to delegitimize political opponents and the media, it is important to understand how politicians and citizens construct different versions of (un)truthfulness. We specifically look at how (radical) right-wing populist politicians and citizens attribute antimedia and anti-elite sentiments in digital media settings. Against this backdrop, this article relies on two qualitative content analyses in the United States and The Netherlands to understand how discourses around (1) the epistemic status of facts and (2) inaccurate and (3) dishonest information are constructed by (radical) right-wing populists and citizens participating in Facebook discussions.

  {"id":"hamiltonRepresentationLearningGraphs2017","abstract":"Machine learning on graphs is an important and ubiquitous task with applications ranging from drug design to friendship recommendation in social networks. The primary challenge in this domain is finding a way to represent, or encode, graph structure so that it can be easily exploited by machine learning models. Traditionally, machine learning approaches relied on user-defined heuristics to extract features encoding structural information about a graph (e.g., degree statistics or kernel functions). However, recent years have seen a surge in approaches that automatically learn to encode graph structure into low-dimensional embeddings, using techniques based on deep learning and nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Here we provide a conceptual review of key advancements in this area of representation learning on graphs, including matrix factorization-based methods, random-walk based algorithms, and graph neural networks. We review methods to embed individual nodes as well as approaches to embed entire (sub)graphs. In doing so, we develop a unified framework to describe these recent approaches, and we highlight a number of important applications and directions for future work.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,23]]},"archive":"arXiv:1709.05584 [cs]","author":[{"family":"Hamilton","given":"William L."},{"family":"Ying","given":"Rex"},{"family":"Leskovec","given":"Jure"}],"container-title":"IEEE Data Engineering","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,16]]},"page":"52-74","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Representation Learning on Graphs: Methods and Applications","title-short":"Representation Learning on Graphs","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05584","volume":"40"},

These perspectives imply that policies that alleviate economic deprivation will equally reduce rates of violent crime in neighborhoods that are predominately white and neighborhoods that are predominately black. In contrast, several social commentators have suggested that alleviating poverty will be a relatively ineffective crime reduction strategy in predominately black areas. Existing empirical research on this issue has been mostly at the city level, and almost entirely cross-sectional. The present study examines potential racial differences in the longitudinal relationship between neighborhood poverty and violent crime rates. We use iteratively reweighted least squares, a robust regression technique, to estimate race-specific effects for Cleveland census tracts, 1990–2000. The results are supportive of the racial invariance hypothesis.

Higher education institutions have invested in many areas to boost the student experience. Student satisfaction has been identified as a key variable in explaining the holistic evaluation of the course. This study aims to fulfil a void in research by developing a study model consisting of cognitive evaluation, affective evaluation and student satisfaction with the course. Furthermore, two constructs of classroom physical environments were added to measure the moderating effect of satisfaction’s antecedents. Results indicated that student satisfaction with a course was significantly explained by cognitive and affective evaluations. Affective evaluation played a mediating role between cognitive evaluation and students’ satisfaction with the course. In addition, the impact of cognitive evaluation was greater than that of affective evaluation. The cognitive and affective evaluation constructs in the proposed theoretical framework accounted for 56% of the variance explained in student satisfaction with the course. Moreover, results of the invariance test revealed that ambient conditions of the classroom and its spatial layout and functionality significantly enhanced the effects of cognitive evaluation and affective evaluation on student satisfaction with the course.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Han","given":"Heesup"},{"family":"Kiatkawsin","given":"Kiattipoom"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Wansoo"},{"family":"Hong","given":"Ju Hea"}],"container-title":"Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education","DOI":"10.1080/02602938.2017.1299855","ISSN":"0260-2938","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,2]]},"page":"110-125","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Physical classroom environment and student satisfaction with courses","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/02602938.2017.1299855","volume":"43"},

  {"id":"hanSwarmDigitalProspects2017","abstract":"A prominent German thinker argues that—contrary to “Twitter Revolution” cheerleading—digital communication is destroying political discourse and political action.The shitstorm represents an authentic phenomenon of digital communication.—from In the SwarmDigital communication and social media have taken over our lives. In this contrarian reflection on digitized life, Byung-Chul Han counters the cheerleaders for Twitter revolutions and Facebook activism by arguing that digital communication is in fact responsible for the disintegration of community and public space and is slowly eroding any possibility for real political action and meaningful political discourse. In the predigital, analog era, by the time an angry letter to the editor had been composed, mailed, and received, the immediate agitation had passed. Today, digital communication enables instantaneous, impulsive reaction, meant to express and stir up outrage on the spot. “The shitstorm,” writes Han, ”represents an authentic phenomenon of digital communication.”Meanwhile, the public, the senders and receivers of these communications have become a digital swarm—not a mass, or a crowd, or Negri and Hardt's antiquated notion of a “multitude,” but a set of isolated individuals incapable of forming a “we,” incapable of calling dominant power relations into question, incapable of formulating a future because of an obsession with the present. The digital swarm is a fragmented entity that can focus on individual persons only in order to make them an object of scandal. Han, one of the most widely read philosophers in Europe today, describes a society in which information has overrun thought, in which the same algorithms are employed by Facebook, the stock market, and the intelligence services. Democracy is under threat because digital communication has made freedom and control indistinguishable. Big Brother has been succeeded by Big Data.","author":[{"family":"Han","given":"Byung-Chul"}],"ISBN":"978-0-262-53336-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,4,7]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"99","publisher":"MIT Press","source":"Google Books","title":"In the Swarm: Digital Prospects","title-short":"In the Swarm","type":"book"},

Recently, however, Matthew Kramer and Ian Carter have questioned whether the harms identified by Pettit under the banner of domination are not equally well accounted for by what they call the ‘pure negative’ view. In this article, first I argue that Pettit’s response to their criticism is problematic insofar as it produces the following dilemma: either Pettit must concede that domination which one regards as consistent with one’s own best interests does not limit one’s freedom or he must embrace the implication that one can be forced to be free, a result he explicitly wants to avoid. Second, I argue that, despite the inadequacy of Pettit’s response, he is ultimately right in thinking that domination and negative liberty are sometimes compatible. My central contention, then, is that neither Pettit’s non-domination view nor Carter and Kramer’s pure negative view are able to account for the loss of liberty one suffers under conditions of domination.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Harbour","given":"Michael David"}],"container-title":"Politics, Philosophy & Economics","container-title-short":"Politics, Philosophy & Economics","DOI":"10.1177/1470594X11416781","ISSN":"1470-594X, 1741-3060","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,5]]},"language":"en","page":"186-205","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Non-domination and pure negative liberty","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1470594X11416781","volume":"11"},

Economists are developing new models of racial profiling to test whether the data are consistent with policing efficiency or racial prejudice, and argue that equal hit rates reflect that the police are maximizing the success rate of their searches. Civil liberties advocates are scrutinizing the same data and, in most cases, reaching opposite conclusions. They argue that equal hit rates merely reflect similar offending patterns by race and thus that the disproportionate searches are racially biased. Meanwhile many constitutional commentators decry racial profiling on the highways as “plainly unconstitutional,” while courts draw technical legal distinctions to easily dispose of civil suits alleging racial profiling on the roads.","author":[{"family":"Harcourt","given":"Bernard E"}],"language":"en","page":"112","source":"Zotero","title":"A CRITIQUE OF THE ECONOMICS, CIVIL LIBERTIES, AND CONSTITUTIONAL LITERATURE AND OF CRIMINAL PROFILING MORE GENERALLY","type":"article-journal"},

The article starts with a list of elements of content moderation up until three decades ago and the follow with a list of elements of content moderation today. The primary goal is to contrast the two scenarios in order to highlight the inconvenience of certain assumptions lawmakers, lawyers and judges make on how communication works in a networked society. I do not intend to provide alternative descriptions to the characteristics of this phenomenon in order to dispute prevailing descriptions. My point is merely to uncover certain aspect that usually remain unnoticed or underestimated in the legal debate about content moderation.

Research finding ways to control the spread of misinformation on SMNs has been emergent. Prior research examined a SMN feature called 'related articles' to provide context directly under SMN posts with potentially misinformed content about controversial topics. Other research examined how SMN users were encouraged to consume online news sources outside their comfort zone when participating within a socialized environment. Each of these features separately were found to significantly reduced misperceptions of SMN users. In this study, we examine how both of these features can work together to reduce the spread of misinformation. We use an experimental survey to measure the effectiveness of SMN features in correcting misperceptions of SMN users and provide results to inform government, cybersecurity firms, social media companies, and SMN users.","author":[{"family":"Hayes","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Oakley","given":"Richelle"}],"container-title":"SAIS 2019 Proceedings","event":"22nd Annual Conference of the Southern Association for Information Systems","event-place":"St. Simons Island, Georgia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,22]]},"publisher":"Southern Association for Information Systems","publisher-place":"St. Simons Island, Georgia","title":"Reducing Misinformation on Social Media Networks","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://aisel.aisnet.org/sais2019/34"},

  {"id":"helbergerGoverningOnlinePlatforms2018","abstract":"Online platforms, from Facebook to Twitter, and from Coursera to Uber, have become deeply involved in a wide range of public activities, including journalism, civic engagement, education, and transport. As such, they have started to play a vital role in the realization of important public values and policy objectives associated with these activities. Based on insights from theories about risk sharing and the problem of many hands, this article develops a conceptual framework for the governance of the public role of platforms, and elaborates on the concept of cooperative responsibility for the realization of critical public policy objectives in Europe. It argues that the realization of public values in platform-based public activities cannot be adequately achieved by allocating responsibility to one central actor (as is currently common practice), but should be the result of dynamic interaction between platforms, users, and public institutions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Helberger","given":"Natali"},{"family":"Pierson","given":"Jo"},{"family":"Poell","given":"Thomas"}],"container-title":"The Information Society","container-title-short":"The Information Society","DOI":"10.1080/01972243.2017.1391913","ISSN":"0197-2243, 1087-6537","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1-14","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Governing online platforms: From contested to cooperative responsibility","title-short":"Governing online platforms","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01972243.2017.1391913","volume":"34"},

When students complain about an instructor, the real problem may be inequitable working conditions. While tenure-line professors rarely teach more than three classes per semester, contingent faculty often teach four or more classes per semester. Tenure-line professors rarely have composition courses; however, contingent faculty members usually must teach a heavy load of first-year composition courses. If colleges involve instructors in shaping policies and evaluation procedures, non-tenure-line faculty will feel more at home in higher education, they will waste less energy combating bureaucratic discrimination, and they will become better teachers. English departments will benefit from the input of more creative minds, and students will be happier and learn more.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Heller","given":"Janet Ruth"}],"container-title":"College Composition and Communication","ISSN":"0010096X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"language":"English","page":"A8-A12","source":"ProQuest","title":"Contingent Faculty and the Evaluation Process","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://search.proquest.com/docview/1081827122/abstract/D37DBDEC610B441DPQ/1","volume":"64"},

  {"id":"hellerTragedyAnticommonsProperty1998","abstract":"Why are many storefronts in Moscow empty, while street kiosks in front are full of goods? In this Article, Professor Heller develops a theory of anticommons property to help explain the puzzle of empty storefronts and full kiosks. Anticommons property can be understood as the mirror image of commons property. By definition, in a commons, multiple owners are each endowed with the privilege to use a given resource, and no one has the right to exclude another. When too many owners hold such privileges of use, the resource is prone to overuse - a tragedy of the commons. Depleted fisheries and overgrazed fields are canonical examples of this familiar tragedy. In an anticommons, according to this Article, multiple owners are each endowed with the right to exclude others from a scarce resource, and no one has an effective privilege of use. When too many owners hold such rights of exclusion, the resource is prone to underuse - a tragedy of the anticommons. Empty Moscow storefronts are a canonical example of the tragedy of underuse. Anticommons property may appear whenever governments define new property rights in both post-socialist and developed market economies. Once an anticommons emerges, collecting rights into usable private property bundles can be brutal and slow. The difficulties of overcoming a tragedy of the anticommons suggest that policymakers should pay more attention to the content of property bundles, rather than focusing just on the clairty of rights.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,3]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Heller","given":"Michael A."}],"container-title":"Harvard Law Review","DOI":"10.2307/1342203","ISSN":"0017-811X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[1998]]},"page":"621-688","publisher":"The Harvard Law Review Association","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Tragedy of the Anticommons: Property in the Transition from Marx to Markets","title-short":"The Tragedy of the Anticommons","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1342203","volume":"111"},

Drawing on the growing comparative literature on courts, we unpack this claim by focusing on two broad questions: How does the type of political regime affect judicial independence? Are independent courts, in fact, always essential for establishing the rule of law? In highlighting the role of institutional fragmentation and public opinion, we explain why democracies are indeed more likely than dictatorships to produce both independent courts and the rule of law. Yet, by also considering the puzzle of institutional instability that marks courts in much of the developing world, we identify several reasons why democracy may not always prove sufﬁcient for constructing either. Finally, we argue that independent courts are not always necessary for the rule of law, particularly where support for individual rights is relatively widespread.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Helmke","given":"Gretchen"},{"family":"Rosenbluth","given":"Frances"}],"container-title":"Annual Review of Political Science","DOI":"10.1146/annurev.polisci.12.040907.121521","ISSN":"1094-2939, 1545-1577","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,6]]},"language":"en","page":"345-366","source":"Crossref","title":"Regimes and the Rule of Law: Judicial Independence in Comparative Perspective","title-short":"Regimes and the Rule of Law","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.polisci.12.040907.121521","volume":"12"},

Using Facebook as a case study, this paper develops a novel methodology for empirically surveying the historical dynamics of social media industry partnerships and partner programs. Facebook is particularly emblematic as one of the few dominant actors that functions both as data aggregator and as digital marketing platform whilst operating a multiplicity of dedicated partner programs that cater to a wide array of industry partners. We employ mixed methods by aligning digital historical research and interview methods: using \"digital methods\", we reconstruct both ongoing and former declared platform--industry partnerships and programs with web data whilst conducting semi-structured interviews with selected platform partners to contextualize the empirical research. This enables us to address (i) the dynamic relations between social media platforms and industry partners, (ii) their diversification by catering to a growing number of stakeholders with distinct interests, and (iii) their gradual entrenchment as dominant actors within an emerging digital marketing ecosystem. By tracing how and when partnerships and industry alliances are forged, sustained, and terminated over time we are able to develop a critical account of the political economy of social data that addresses the politics of platforms and stakeholders as well as the consolidation of platform power.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Helmond","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Nieborg","given":"David B."},{"family":"Vlist","given":"Fernando N.","non-dropping-particle":"van der"}],"collection-title":"#SMSociety17","container-title":"Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Social Media & Society","DOI":"10.1145/3097286.3097324","event-place":"Toronto, ON, Canada","ISBN":"978-1-4503-4847-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,7,28]]},"page":"1–5","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"Toronto, ON, Canada","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"The Political Economy of Social Data: A Historical Analysis of Platform-Industry Partnerships","title-short":"The Political Economy of Social Data","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://doi.org/10.1145/3097286.3097324"},
  {"id":"helmondSocialMediaPlatform","abstract":"In this article, we propose a methodological outlook for historical platform studies to increase the prominence of platform historiography in the field and practice of web history and archiving. We discuss the challenges of social media archiving and the research opportunities for ‘platform’ historiography by focusing on the distinctive characteristics of web-based social media ‘platforms’. Based on our review of the literature, we argue that it is critical to foreground how contemporary platforms serve multiple user groups beyond end users (e.g. developers, business, investors) and how they operate on multiple levels (e.g. interface, architecture, ecosystem). By attending to the multiple sides and layers of social media beyond their end users only, we can reconstruct histories of platforms, not only as social networks, but also as technical artefacts, business organisations, and more. A focus on the materiality of platforms introduces numerous underutilised archived web sources that present significant entry points and research opportunities for platform historiography. We assess the availability of these archived sources across the leading web archives. Our results show that despite the challenges of social media archiving, platforms’ resources are in fact well-preserved if we look beyond their end-user interfaces. Drawing on illustrative examples, we discuss two sets of entry points and materials for platform historiography at length: first, for writing developer-side histories, and second, for business-side histories. We conclude with recommendations for platform historians and archiving practitioners and reflections on the future of platform historiography.","author":[{"family":"Helmond","given":"Anne"}],"language":"en","page":"29","source":"Zotero","title":"Social Media and Platform Historiography: Challenges and Opportunities","type":"article-journal"},

This special issue critically explores the question, “Is social media for good or evil?” While good and evil are both moral terms, the research addresses whether the benefits of using social media in society outweigh the drawbacks. To help conceptualize this topic, we examine some of the benefits (good) and drawbacks (evil) of using social media as discussed in eight papers from the 2017 International Conference on Social Media and Society. This thematic collection reflects a broad range of topics, using diverse methods, from authors around the world and highlights different ways that social media is used for good, or evil, or both. We conclude that the determination of good and evil depends on where you stand, but as researchers, we need to go a step further to understand who it is good for and who it might hurt.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Hemsley","given":"Jeff"},{"family":"Jacobson","given":"Jenna"},{"family":"Gruzd","given":"Anatoliy"},{"family":"Mai","given":"Philip"}],"container-title":"Social Media + Society","container-title-short":"Social Media + Society","DOI":"10.1177/2056305118786719","ISSN":"2056-3051","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"2056305118786719","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Social Media for Social Good or Evil: An Introduction","title-short":"Social Media for Social Good or Evil","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/2056305118786719","volume":"4"},

Using detailed case studies and combining different theoretical perspectives, this book explores the legal consciousness of ordinary people, businessmen, and street-level bureaucrats in the Netherlands. The empirical research in this study tells an original and alternative narrative about the role of law in everyday life. While previous studies emphasize the law’s hegemony and argue that it’s ‘all over’, Hertogh shows that legal proliferation makes it harder for people to know, and subsequently identify with, the law. As a result, official law has become increasingly remote and irrelevant to many people. The central finding presented in this highly topical text is that these developments signal a process of ‘legal alienation’— a gradual and mundane process with potentially serious consequences for the legitimacy of law.

In fact, I find that parties in the electorate have experienced a noteworthy resurgence over the last two decades. Greater partisan polarization in Congress has clarified the parties’ ideological positions for ordinary Americans, which in turn has increased party importance and salience on the mass level. Although parties in the 1990s are not as central to Americans as they were in the 1950s, they are far more important today than in the 1970s and 1980s.

  {"id":"higginsDemocracyFeminism1997","abstract":"Although feminist legal theory has had an important impact on most areas of legal doctrine and theory over the last two decades, its contribution to the debate over constitutional interpretation has been comparatively small. In this Article, Professor Higgins explores reasons for the limited dialogue between mainstream constitutional theory and feminist theory concerning questions of democracy, constitutionalism, and judicial review. She argues that mainstream constitutional theory tends to take for granted the capacity of the individual to make choices, leaving the social construction of those choices largely unexamined. In contrast, feminist legal theory's emphasis on the importance of constraints on women's choices has led to a neglect of questions of citizenship and sovereignty within a democratic system. By comparing mainstream constitutional theory and feminist theory, Professor Higgins highlights the existing limitations of both. She argues both that mainstream constitutional theory must take into account feminist arguments concerning constraints on individual choice and that feminist theory must take seriously the mainstream debate over democratic legitimacy. Integrating these distinct concerns, she suggests a framework for constitutional interpretation that reflects a feminist conception of citizenship under conditions of inequality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Higgins","given":"Tracy E."}],"container-title":"Harvard Law Review","DOI":"10.2307/1342041","ISSN":"0017-811X","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[1997]]},"page":"1657-1703","source":"JSTOR","title":"Democracy and Feminism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1342041","volume":"110"},

  {"id":"hillEmpireMegamachineComparing2019","abstract":"This paper presents the results of a thematic analysis of hearings held before the US senate in 2017 with representatives of social media companies and close coverage from industry groups of advertising boycotts of social media. In response to the public pressure, social media companies increased their investment in machine learning and human moderation to remove inappropriate content and increased transparency initiatives. The two scenarios indicate the importance of content to questions of platform governance and the ability of the advertising industry to act as a platform regulator. This paper uses the political economic analysis of Harold Innis and theoretical work on the megamachine as a framework for understanding how governance may be enacted through commercial systems before and around government policy tools. It argues that social media companies’ actions indicate an expanded role for marketing and advertising as governors of media content delivery, resulting in the efficient administration of advertiser concerns while democratic representatives take a comparatively slow road.","author":[{"family":"Hill","given":"Stephanie"}],"issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"18","source":"Zotero","title":"Empire and the megamachine: comparing two controversies over social media content","type":"article-journal","volume":"8"},
  {"id":"hillerFirmCommonPool2018","abstract":"In September 2015, the crowdfunding site Kickstarter announced that it would adopt a new corporate form, that of a benefit corporation. Kickstarter is far from alone in this decision; in fact, it joined a growing list of tech firms that are moving toward adopting a benefit corporation designation. The result of the legal movement is that corporate governance across the nation may be changing, impacting everything from business ethics training to board decision making, with potentially wide-ranging implications for the economy, environment, and civil society. Despite its growing popularity, though, the rationale behind the emergence of benefit corporations is an understudied question. In this article, we argue that benefit incorporation affects the very nature of the corporation by creating corporate common pool resources (CPRs) and that the CPR theory provides a way to understand the puzzle and future of the movement. This approach is important because it resituates the conversation, from a narrow view of the effect of the legislation on traditional corporate concepts to a broader view of the impact of the legislation. Furthermore, we consider the benefit corporation through the lens of Professor Elinor Ostrom's design principles, offering a unique perspective through which to analyze if the designs of state statutes and implementation by business entities meet criteria that would predict successful governance of the benefit corporation CPR.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Hiller","given":"Janine S."},{"family":"Shackelford","given":"Scott J."}],"container-title":"American Business Law Journal","DOI":"10.1111/ablj.12116","ISSN":"1744-1714","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ablj.12116","page":"5-51","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The Firm and Common Pool Resource Theory: Understanding the Rise of Benefit Corporations","title-short":"The Firm and Common Pool Resource Theory","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ablj.12116","volume":"55"},

Her most recent book, Cities and the Wealth of the Nations, extends her earlier urban design and economic thought to the regional, national, and international scales, and it completes the sketch of a general theory of planning. Despite her great popularity, her many formulations have not been summarized for professional planning audiences, located in the context of other planning ideas, or assessed for theoretical quality. This article addresses each of those topics. I find her theoretical strengths to be originality, emotional force, style, and timeliness.

  {"id":"hinkelEnhancingOstromSocialecological2014","abstract":"Frameworks play an important role in analyzing social-ecological systems (SESs) because they provide shared concepts and variables that enable comparison between and accumulation of knowledge across multiple cases. One prominent SES framework focusing on local resource use has been developed by Elinor Ostrom and her colleagues. This framework is an extensive multi-tier collection of concepts and variables that have demonstrated relevance for explaining outcomes in a large number of case studies in the context of fishery, water, and forestry common-pool resources. The further development of this framework has raised a number of issues related to the formal relationships between the large number of concepts and variables involved. In particular, issues related to criteria for ordering the concepts into tiers, adding new concepts, defining outcomes metrics, and representing dynamics in the framework have been identified. We address these issues by applying methods from research fields that study formal relationships between concepts such as domain-specific languages, knowledge representation, and software engineering. We find that SES frameworks could include the following seven formal components: variables, concepts, attribution relationships, subsumption relationships, process relationships, aggregation relationships, and evaluation metrics. Applying these components to the Ostrom framework and a case study of recreational fishery, we find that they provide clear criteria for structuring concepts into tiers, defining outcome metrics, and representing dynamics. The components identified are generic, and the insights gained from this exercise may also be beneficial for the development of other SES frameworks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Hinkel","given":"Jochen"},{"family":"Bots","given":"Pieter W.

The framing of information architecture as an essential part of Design Thinking extends current and historic notions of the field of information architecture. The discussion introduces the notion of the ‘contrived ontology’ which can be understood as the intentional meaning that design infuses in its artefacts, services and systems. Further, we argue that contrived ontology aligns with central themes within humanistic frameworks which view reality as subjective construct. This forms the central theoretical meditation herein: we contend that while design is always an act of interpreted cultural determination, at the scale of Floridi’s infosphere, the immediacy and immersive social reality of technology will become frictionless within our human experience. As this occurs, there is a moral and ethical imperative to ensure social sustainability and to this end that the meanings and intentions that inform the mature design of our human-made world are visible and accountable. It is towards this end that information architecture can make a valuable contribution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Hobbs","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Fenn","given":"Terence"}],"container-title":"Philosophy & Technology","DOI":"10.1007/s13347-018-0338-y","ISSN":"2210-5433, 2210-5441","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12]]},"language":"en","page":"745-767","source":"Crossref","title":"The Design of Socially Sustainable Ontologies","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13347-018-0338-y","volume":"32"},

(2019) highlight the importance of conducting institutional analysis and experimentation as a means toward robust, adaptable polycentric governance. For policy researchers, engaging in the practice of polycentric political economy means analyzing the role of alternative governance mechanisms at the constitutional, policy, and operational levels of social interaction. In order to demonstrate how policymakers can engage in institutional analysis at each level, we examine the case study of state regulatory reform. We find that the pursuit of marginal improvements within an existing governance framework can contribute to institutional reform if researchers are focused on long-run institutional change. This requires looking at policy research as part of a process aimed at institutional experimentation and the reimagination of governance frameworks within a polycentric environment where researchers engage in coproduction of an adaptive and sustainable governance system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Hobson","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Norcross","given":"Eileen"}],"container-title":"The Review of Austrian Economics","container-title-short":"Rev Austrian Econ","DOI":"10.1007/s11138-019-00491-8","ISSN":"1573-7128","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,7]]},"language":"en","source":"Springer Link","title":"A call for institutional analysis: practicing polycentric political economy in policy research","title-short":"A call for institutional analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11138-019-00491-8"},
  {"id":"hodgsonFrenchProsecutorQuestion","abstract":"Both the pre-trial and dispositive roles of the French prosecutor have continued to expand over the last decades with a resulting shift in power away from the trial judge and the juge d’instruction. The recommendations of the Léger Commission in 2009 went beyond the redistribution of authority and proposed the abolition of the juge d’instruction, placing the prosecutor in charge of all criminal investigations, even the most serious, complex, and sensitive. At the same time, the prosecutor’s role and status has been challenged in a number of ways—in particular concerning her function as judicial supervisor of the detention and interrogation of suspects in the garde à vue. The case of Medvedyev v. France called into question the prosecutor’s status as a judge and the string of cases beginning with Salduz v. Turkey has caused several jurisdictions, including France, to reconsider the provision made for custodial legal advice. There is a real tension between the direction of reforms proposed within France and the pressure from Europe to ensure more effective due process safeguards. As a result of domestic litigation and constitutional challenge, the French government is slowly relenting and allowing lawyers a greater role. It has yet to grasp the nettle of the independence of the prosecutor, however. The ECtHR has made it clear that a judge must be independent of the executive and of the case parties—both of which are contested in relation to the French prosecutor. Within a procedural model in which defense rights are secondary to the supposed truth-seeking ideology of the judicial supervisor, the independence of the prosecutor is crucial.","author":[{"family":"Hodgson","given":"Jacqueline S"}],"language":"en","page":"51","source":"Zotero","title":"The French Prosecutor in Question","type":"article-journal"},

Lower policy adoption is explained by capacity constraints. More policy making occurs in states with a multilevel governance framework supportive of local sustainability action. Contrary to Fischel’s homevoter hypothesis, we find large cities and rural areas show higher levels of adoption than suburbs (possibly due to free riding within a metropolitan region).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Homsy","given":"George C."},{"family":"Warner","given":"Mildred E."}],"container-title":"Urban Affairs Review","DOI":"10.1177/1078087414530545","ISSN":"1078-0874, 1552-8332","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,1]]},"language":"en","page":"46-73","source":"Crossref","title":"Cities and Sustainability: Polycentric Action and Multilevel Governance","title-short":"Cities and Sustainability","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1078087414530545","volume":"51"},
  {"id":"homsyClimateChangeCoProduction2013","abstract":"Climate change requires action at multiple levels of government. We focus on the potential for climate change policy creation among small rural governments in the USA. We argue that co-production of scientiﬁc knowledge and policy is a communicative approach that encompasses local knowledge ﬂowing up from rural governments as well as expertise and power (to coordinate and ensure compliance) ﬂowing down from higher level authority. Using environmental examples related to land use policy, natural gas hydro-fracturing, and watershed protection, we demonstrate the importance of knowledge ﬂows, power, and coordination in policy creation. Co-production of knowledge and policy requires respect for local knowledge and a broader framing of issues to include both environmental and economic perspectives. While we see potential for local action, we caution that polycentric approaches lead to externality problems that require multilevel governance to ensure coordination and compliance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Homsy","given":"George C."},{"family":"Warner","given":"Mildred E."}],"container-title":"Sociologia Ruralis","DOI":"10.1111/soru.12013","ISSN":"00380199","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,7]]},"language":"en","page":"291-310","source":"Crossref","title":"Climate Change and the Co-Production of Knowledge and Policy in Rural USA Communities: Climate change and co-production of knowledge and policy","title-short":"Climate Change and the Co-Production of Knowledge and Policy in Rural USA Communities","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/soru.12013","volume":"53"},

In this framework, problem-solving agents possess representations of problems and algorithms that they use to locate solutions. We use this framework to establish a result relevant to group composition. We find that when selecting a problem-solving team from a diverse population of intelligent agents, a team of randomly selected agents outperforms a team comprised of the best-performing agents. This result relies on the intuition that, as the initial pool of problem solvers becomes large, the best-performing agents necessarily become similar in the space of problem solvers.

  {"id":"hongIncentivesInformationEmergent2012","abstract":"In this paper, we construct a framework within which we explore how incentives and information structures influence the ability of a collection of individuals to make an accurate aggregate prediction. In our framework, individuals of bounded ability predict outcomes that depend on the values of a set of attributes. Individual construct models consider only a subset of those attributes, and those models depend on their incentives and their information environments. We consider two types of incentive structures: one in which individuals get paid on the basis of accuracy and one based on market like, for example, parimutuel payoffs. We also consider two information environments: one in which individuals learn in isolation and another in which they can copy more successful predictors. We find that market incentives and isolated learning environments produce the most accurate aggregate predictions but that these same incentives and information structures also produce the least accurate individuals. Thus, the incentives and informational structures that produce collective wisdom may hinge on their ability to produce and maintain diversity.

Current research on the relationship between gender and evaluation is summarized.

Since the everyday art of teaching is reflected in and guided by the feedback faculty receive from students, the role gender plays in teacher evaluations is clearly  important.

A future article based on this now invaluable material has been commissioned by European Planning Studies.

  {"id":"howardDemocracyFourthWave2013","abstract":"In 2011, the international community watched as a shockingly unlikely community of citizens toppled three of the world's most entrenched dictators: Ben Ali in Tunisia, Mubarak in Egypt, and Qaddafi in Libya. This movement of cascading democratization, commonly known as the Arab Spring, was planned and executed not by political parties, but by students, young entrepreneurs, and the rising urban middle class. International experts and the popular press have pointed to the near-identical reliance on digital media in all three movements, arguing that these authoritarian regimes were in essence defeated by the Internet. Is that true? Should Mubarak blame Twitter for his sudden fall from power? Did digital media \"cause\" the Arab Spring? In Democracy's Fourth Wave?, Philip N. Howard and Muzammil M. Hussain examine the complex role of the Internet, mobile phones, and social networking applications in the Arab Spring. Examining digital media access, level of grievance, and levels of protest for popular democratization in 16 countries in the Middle East and North Africa, Howard and Hussain conclude that digital media was neither the most nor the least important cause of the Arab Spring. Instead, they illustrate a complex web of conjoined causal factors for social mobilization. The Arab revolts cascaded across countries largely because digital media allowed communities to realize shared grievances and nurtured transportable strategies for mobilizing against dictators. Individuals were inspired to protest for personal reasons, but through social media they acted collectively. Democracy's Fourth Wave examines not only the unexpected evolution of events during the Arab Spring, but the longer history of desperate-and creative-digital activism through the Arab world.","author":[{"family":"Howard","given":"Philip N."},{"family":"Hussain","given":"Muzammil M."}],"ISBN":"978-0-19-993695-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,4,4]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"145","publisher":"OUP USA","title":"Democracy's Fourth Wave?: Digital Media and the Arab Spring","title-short":"Democracy's Fourth Wave?","type":"book","URL":"https://books.google.com/books?id=ayHOyrmmT8kC"},

This research examines the relationship between race and evaluations of the police in majority black versus majority white contexts. Social dominance theory and the research on racial threat predict that when the racial majority changes, the relationship between race and attitudes toward police will change. We find that, in majority black contexts, the traditional relationship between being black and having negative evaluations of the police disappears, and it disappears because whites' evaluations of the police become more negative. Black evaluations of the police are relatively consistent across racial contexts. Also, white racial attitudes affect police evaluations in majority black contexts, but not in white contexts, while African American racial attitudes are inconsequential in both contexts. Furthermore, if a white citizen is victimized by crime in a black city, it has greater ramifications for evaluations of the police than if the victimization had occurred in a white city. All of this suggests that whites' views of the police may be more racialized than the views of African Americans.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Howell","given":"Susan E."},{"family":"Perry","given":"Huey L."},{"family":"Vile","given":"Matthew"}],"container-title":"Political Behavior","container-title-short":"Political Behavior","DOI":"10.1023/B:POBE.0000022343.51330.1e","ISSN":"1573-6687","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"45-68","source":"Springer Link","title":"Black Cities/White Cities: Evaluating the Police","title-short":"Black Cities/White Cities","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1023/B:POBE.0000022343.51330.1e","volume":"26"},

  {"id":"hoyeSurveillanceFreedomRepublic2018","abstract":"Arbitrary state and corporate powers are helping to turn the Internet into a global surveillance dragnet. Responses to this novel form of power have been tepid and ineffective. Liberal critiques of surveillance are constrained by their focus on privacy, security and the underlying presupposition that freedom consists only of freedom from interference. By contrast, (post)Foucauldian critiques rejecting liberalism have been well rewarded analytically, but have proven incapable of addressing normative questions regarding the relationship between surveillance and freedom. Quite apart from these debates, neorepublicans have excavated a third concept of freedom, understood as non-domination. Could neorepublicanism overcome the limitations of liberal and (post)Foucauldian critiques of surveillance? We argue, positively, that neorepublicanism can accommodate much of the (post)Foucauldian analyses while also incorporating a normative critique of surveillance vis-a`-vis freedom. We further argue, negatively, that surveillance power has outstripped the capacities of traditional republican institutional responses to domination. We conclude by considering ways in which neorepublicanism can be recalibrated to address the novelty of surveillance power while adhering to the ideal of non-domination. Two ways of addressing the problem are proposed: an offensive, dedicated surveillance antipower and a defensive republican amplification of privacy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Hoye","given":"J.

  {"id":"huangProfitMakingStateFirms2012","abstract":"State-owned “enterprises” from the planned era, converted into profit-making state firms in the 2000s, have been playing a major role in the continued spectacular growth of China’s GDP. This fact, however, has been obscured by hegemonic neoliberal economic discourse with its assumption that only private firms can drive economic development, thereby turning what is a major dynamic into a major failing. At the same time, by a variety of abstract constructs founded on theoretical speculations rather than empirical reality, neoliberal economic and sociological discourse has also obscured the mounting social inequalities that have accompanied Chinese development. The evidence shows that central and local Chinese government actions lie at the root of the growing social inequalities. This article ends with a discussion of the new Chongqing experiment and its implications for the big issue of the direction of China’s future development: whether “state capitalism” or “socialist market economy,” not in rhetoric but in actual substance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Huang","given":"Philip C.C."}],"container-title":"Modern China","container-title-short":"Modern China","DOI":"10.1177/0097700412455839","ISSN":"0097-7004","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"591-629","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Profit-Making State Firms and China’s Development Experience: “State Capitalism” or “Socialist Market Economy”?","title-short":"Profit-Making State Firms and China’s Development Experience","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0097700412455839","volume":"38"},

Initially, governance practices follow ecosystem-wide rules; if and how practices shift toward going beyond the rules hinges on specific necessary conditions. Irrespective of which governance route is taken, the tension between cocreated value and governance costs is more successfully addressed if practices are sensitive to ecosystem-wide values.The online appendix is available at https://doi-org.proxy.lib.uiowa.edu/10.1287/isre.2017.0701.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Huber","given":"Thomas L."},{"family":"Kude","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Dibbern","given":"Jens"}],"container-title":"Information Systems Research","container-title-short":"Information Systems Research","DOI":"10.1287/isre.2017.0701","ISSN":"1047-7047","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,6,6]]},"page":"563-584","publisher":"INFORMS","source":"pubsonline-informs-org.proxy.lib.uiowa.edu (Atypon)","title":"Governance Practices in Platform Ecosystems: Navigating Tensions Between Cocreated Value and Governance Costs","title-short":"Governance Practices in Platform Ecosystems","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/isre.2017.0701","volume":"28"},
  {"id":"huckleFakeNewsTechnological2017","abstract":"In this article, we introduce a prototype of an innovative technology for proving the origins of captured digital media. In an era of fake news, when someone shows us a video or picture of some event, how can we trust its authenticity? It seems that the public no longer believe that traditional media is a reliable reference of fact, perhaps due, in part, to the onset of many diverse sources of conflicting information, via social media. Indeed, the issue of “fake” reached a crescendo during the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election, when the winner, Donald Trump, claimed that The New York Times was trying to discredit him by pushing disinformation. Current research into overcoming the problem of fake news does not focus on establishing the ownership of media resources used in such stories—the blockchain-based application introduced in this article is technology that is capable of indicating the authenticity of digital media. Put simply, using the trust mechanisms of blockchain technology, the tool can show, beyond doubt, the provenance of any source of digital media, including images used out of context in attempts to mislead. Although the application is an early prototype and its capability to find fake resources is somewhat limited, we outline future improvements that would overcome such limitations. Furthermore, we believe that our application (and its use of blockchain technology and standardized metadata) introduces a novel approach to overcoming falsities in news reporting and the provenance of media resources used therein. However, while our application has the potential to be able to verify the originality of media resources, we believe that technology is only capable of providing a partial solution to fake news. That is because it is incapable of proving the authenticity of a news story as a whole. We believe that takes human skills.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Huckle","given":"Steve"},{"family":"White","given":"Martin"}],"container-title":"Big Data","container-title-short":"Big Data","DOI":"10.1089/big.2017.0071","ISSN":"2167-6461","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,12,1]]},"page":"356-371","title":"Fake News: A Technological Approach to Proving the Origins of Content, Using Blockchains","title-short":"Fake News","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/big.2017.0071","volume":"5"},

The dynamic relations between governments, corporations and citizens are being renegotiated through the algorithmic formations of data mining and through contract law in the form of End User Licence Agreements. To analyse how the current practices and discourses associated with the socio-technical assemblages of online social worlds work within the broader political economy this article considers discourses associated with risk and security (Dean 2010), practices and discourses associated with algorithms (Gillespie forthcoming 2014) and the new shape of 'predictive surveillance' in the form of panspectralism (Palmås 2011). The emerging patterns of governance through contractual law and algorithms are enabling the discursive construction of a differently balanced set of relations between citizens, governments and corporations. The overlapping interests of these stakeholders are considered, and the strong alliances between corporations and the security arms of governments are identified.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Humphreys","given":"Sal"}],"container-title":"International Journal of Media & Cultural Politics","container-title-short":"International Journal of Media & Cultural Politics","DOI":"10.1386/macp.9.3.247_1","ISSN":"17408296","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,9]]},"page":"247-258","publisher":"Intellect Ltd.","source":"EBSCOhost","title":"Predicting, securing and shaping the future: Mechanisms of governance in online social environments","title-short":"Predicting, securing and shaping the future","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://proxy.lib.uiowa.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ufh&AN=94905042","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"humprechtWhereFakeNews2019","abstract":"How does the content of so-called ‘fake news’ differ across Western democracies? While previous research on online disinformation has focused on the individual level, the current study aims to shed light on cross-national differences. It compares online disinformation re-published by fact checkers from four Western democracies (the US, the UK, Germany, and Austria). The findings reveal significant differences between English-speaking and German-speaking countries. In the US and the UK, the largest shares of partisan disinformation are found, while in Germany and Austria sensationalist stories prevail. Moreover, in English-speaking countries, disinformation frequently attacks political actors, whereas in German-speaking countries, immigrants are most frequently targeted. Across all of the countries, topics of false stories strongly mirror national news agendas. Based on these results, the paper argues that online disinformation is not only a technology-driven phenomenon but also shaped by national information environments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Humprecht","given":"Edda"}],"container-title":"Information, Communication & Society","DOI":"10.1080/1369118X.2018.1474241","ISSN":"1369-118X","issue":"13","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,10]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2018.1474241","page":"1973-1988","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Where ‘fake news’ flourishes: a comparison across four Western democracies","title-short":"Where ‘fake news’ flourishes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2018.1474241","volume":"22"},
  {"id":"huntAlgorithmicRegulationMedia2019","abstract":"ABSTRACT The word “algorithm” is best understood as a generic term for automated decision-making. Algorithms can be coded by humans or they can become self-taught through machine learning. Cultural goods and news increasingly pass through information intermediaries known as platforms that rely on algorithms to filter, rank, sort, classify, and promote information. Algorithmic content recommendation acts as an important and increasingly contentious gatekeeper. Numerous controversies around the nature of content being recommended—from disturbing children's videos to conspiracies and political misinformation—have undermined confidence in the neutrality of these systems. Amid a generational challenge for media policy, algorithmic accountability has emerged as one area of regulatory innovation. Algorithmic accountability seeks to explain automated decision-making, ultimately locating responsibility and improving the overall system. This article focuses on the technical, systemic issues related to algorithmic accountability, highlighting that deployment matters as much as development when explaining algorithmic outcomes. After outlining the challenges faced by those seeking to enact algorithmic accountability, we conclude by comparing some emerging approaches to addressing cultural discoverability by different international policymakers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,18]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Hunt","given":"Robert"},{"family":"McKelvey","given":"Fenwick"}],"container-title":"Journal of Information Policy","DOI":"10.5325/jinfopoli.9.2019.0307","ISSN":"2381-5892","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"page":"307-335","source":"JSTOR","title":"Algorithmic Regulation in Media and Cultural Policy: A Framework to Evaluate Barriers to Accountability","title-short":"Algorithmic Regulation in Media and Cultural Policy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/jinfopoli.9.2019.0307","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"hutchinsonDemocracyConstitutionalChange2011","abstract":"The relationship between democracy and constitutions is a long and fractious one. Those who lean towards the constitutionalist side have tended to perceive democracy as a threat to political order and the preservation of important values, whereas those who take a more democratist stance tend to treat constitutions as elite hindrances to popular rule as much as anything else. In this paper, we will give the constitutionalist thesis a broader theoretical and political scrutiny. By way of explanation, we will address and recommend the possibilities and problems for putting into practical operation such an anti-constitutionalist stance; the recent experience of the U.S. State of California offers itself as a good forcing-ground for these ideas. In short, from a democratic standpoint, the challenge for the citizenry is not so much about defining the values of constitutions, but constitutions whose change is outside the scope of popular decision making, supposed to exclusively take place through judicial interpretation or through an amendment formula designed precisely to make change difficult and unlikely. Too often, constitutions place checks and limits on democratic participation in the name of some other set of vaunted truths or elite-favouring values. For the strong democrat, it is formal constitutions and their institutional paraphernalia that do more to inhibit and dull democracy's emancipatory potential than to nurture and fulfil it.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Hutchinson","given":"Allan C."},{"family":"Colón-Ríos","given":"Joel"}],"container-title":"Theoria: A Journal of Social and Political Theory","ISSN":"0040-5817","issue":"127","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"page":"43-62","source":"JSTOR","title":"Democracy and Constitutional Change","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/41802504","volume":"58"},

  {"id":"ingberBureaucraticResistanceNational","abstract":"Modern accounts of the national security state tend toward one of two opposing views of bureaucratic tensions within it: At one extreme, the executive branch bureaucracy is a shadowy “deep state,” unaccountable to the public or even to the elected President. On this account, bureaucratic obstacles to the President’s agenda are inherently suspect, even dangerous. At the other end, bureaucratic resistance to the President represents a necessary benevolent constraint on an otherwise imperial executive. This account hails the bureaucracy as the modern incarnation of the separation of powers, an alternative to the traditional checks on the President of the courts and Congress, which are faulted with falling down on the job. These “deep state” and “benevolent constraints” approaches to bureaucratic behavior track debates in the scholarship over the legitimacy of the administrative state more broadly, and are used as rhetorical devices to challenge or defend current allocations of power. These accounts lead, respectively, to fear of or overreliance on bureaucratic resistance—which I define here broadly as action or inaction within the executive branch that hinders executive movement—as a means of checking Presidential power. Fear of bureaucratic resistance results in an erosion of valuable internal checks on the President. Alternatively, overreliance on these internal checks may result in complacency, and an abdication of responsibility by the traditional external checks, namely members of Congress and the courts. Both approaches result in an insufficiently constrained President, which should concern most advocates and opponents of the administrative state.","author":[{"family":"Ingber","given":"Rebecca"}],"container-title":"IOWA LAW REVIEW","language":"en","page":"84","source":"Zotero","title":"Bureaucratic Resistance and the National Security State","type":"article-journal","volume":"104"},

  {"id":"inglehartTrumpPopulistAuthoritarian2017","abstract":"Growing up taking survival for granted makes people more open to new ideas and more tolerant of outgroups. Insecurity has the opposite effect, stimulating an Authoritarian Reflex in which people close ranks behind strong leaders, with strong in-group solidarity, rejection of outsiders, and rigid conformity to group norms. The 35 years of exceptional security experienced by developed democracies after WWII brought pervasive cultural changes, including the rise of Green parties and the spread of democracy. During the past 35 years, economic growth continued, but virtually all of the gains went to those at the top; the less-educated experienced declining existential security, fueling support for Populist Authoritarian phenomena such as Brexit, France’s National Front and Trump’s takeover of the Republican party. This raises two questions: (1) “What motivates people to support Populist Authoritarian movements?” And (2) “Why is the populist authoritarian vote so much higher now than it was several decades ago in high-income countries?” The two questions have different answers. Support for populist authoritarian parties is motivated by a backlash against cultural change. From the start, younger Postmaterialist birth cohorts supported environmentalist parties, while older, less secure cohorts supported authoritarian xenophobic parties, in an enduring intergenerational value clash. But for the past three decades, strong period effects have been working to increase support for xenophobic parties: economic gains have gone almost entirely to those at the top, while a large share of the population experienced declining real income and job security, along with a large influx of immigrants and refugees. Cultural backlash explains why given individuals support Populist Authoritarian movements. Declining existential security explains why support for these movements is greater now than it was thirty years ago.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Inglehart","given":"Ronald"},{"family":"Norris","given":"Pippa"}],"container-title":"Perspectives on Politics","DOI":"10.1017/S1537592717000111","ISSN":"1537-5927, 1541-0986","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,6]]},"language":"en","page":"443-454","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Trump and the Populist Authoritarian Parties: The Silent Revolution in Reverse","title-short":"Trump and the Populist Authoritarian Parties","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/trump-and-the-populist-authoritarian-parties-the-silent-revolution-in-reverse/FE06E514F88A13C8DBFD41984D12D88D","volume":"15"},

It discusses the history of policing in Nigeria and the challenges affecting the one-agency police institution which is the conventional Nigeria Police Force. The inability of the NPF to control the rising spate of crime and the fact that the institution is regarded as oppressive tool in the hands of the rich has given room for public distrust and subsequent debate on how to improve safety and security for foreigners and Nigerians within the country. The partnership theory of Dennis Rosenbaum is the theoretical framework that is adopted as a guide to this study. The paper recommends amongst others that the informal police methodology should be recognized by the government and given the necessary financial support to partner with the formal police force in order to enhance the process of providing security for Nigerians and foreigners residing and doing business in the country. Furthermore, the study has suggested that a code of conduct should be enacted by the legislative arm of government to assist regularized activities of the informal police sector who are often blamed for brutality during the exercise of their duties.","author":[{"family":"Inyang","given":"John Domingo"}],"language":"en","page":"6","source":"Zotero","title":"Policing Nigeria: A case for partnership between formal and informal police institutions","type":"article-journal"},

This article examines the pressure for a new regulatory framework for the information intermediaries both within and outside the media industry, notably in Europe, noting that the range of issues thrown up by the operations of the information intermediaries now engage a wider focus than media policy per se, including data and privacy policy, national security, hate speech and other issues. The concept of ‘fake news’ emerges as only one of the drivers of policy change: the dominance of information intermediaries such as Facebook and Google in respect of the digital advertising market and data monopolisation may be even more significant. The article asks whether a new concept of ‘information utilities’ may be appropriate to capture their increasingly dominant role.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Iosifidis","given":"Petros"},{"family":"Andrews","given":"Leighton"}],"container-title":"International Communication Gazette","container-title-short":"International Communication Gazette","DOI":"10.1177/1748048519828595","ISSN":"1748-0485","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,12]]},"language":"en","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Regulating the internet intermediaries in a post-truth world: Beyond media policy?","title-short":"Regulating the internet intermediaries in a post-truth world","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1748048519828595"},

Most contemporary scholars, although arriving at this conclusion from quite varied premises, have suggested that such a position advocates an overly naive approach to the text. Responding to these critics, I demonstrate that Douglass’s jurisprudence, which I classify as “reform textualism,” is both legally plausible and normatively attractive. This is because Douglass succeeds in grounding his constitutional interpretation in both the text of the Constitution and a defensible philosophy of law. By taking the words of the Preamble seriously and generating a compelling account of the purpose and nature of law, Frederick Douglass presents a textually grounded, “moral reading” of the Constitution, without recourse to either originalism or the concept of the living Constitution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Ives","given":"Anthony Lister"}],"container-title":"The Journal of Politics","container-title-short":"The Journal of Politics","DOI":"10.1086/694257","ISSN":"0022-3816","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,31]]},"page":"88-102","source":"www-journals-uchicago-edu.proxy.lib.uiowa.edu (Atypon)","title":"Frederick Douglass’s Reform Textualism: An Alternative Jurisprudence Consistent with the Fundamental Purpose of Law","title-short":"Frederick Douglass’s Reform Textualism","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/694257","volume":"80"},

  {"id":"jacksonHashtagActivismNetworksRace2020","abstract":"How marginalized groups use Twitter to advance counter-narratives, preempt political spin, and build diverse networks of dissent.The power of hashtag activism became clear in 2011, when #IranElection served as an organizing tool for Iranians protesting a disputed election and offered a global audience a front-row seat to a nascent revolution. Since then, activists have used a variety of hashtags, including #JusticeForTrayvon, #BlackLivesMatter, #YesAllWomen, and #MeToo to advocate, mobilize, and communicate. In this book, Sarah Jackson, Moya Bailey, and Brooke Foucault Welles explore how and why Twitter has become an important platform for historically disenfranchised populations, including Black Americans, women, and transgender people. They show how marginalized groups, long excluded from elite media spaces, have used Twitter hashtags to advance counternarratives, preempt political spin, and build diverse networks of dissent. The authors describe how such hashtags as #MeToo, #SurvivorPrivilege, and #WhyIStayed have challenged the conventional understanding of gendered violence; examine the voices and narratives of Black feminism enabled by #FastTailedGirls, #YouOKSis, and #SayHerName; and explore the creation and use of #GirlsLikeUs, a network of transgender women. They investigate the digital signatures of the “new civil rights movement”―the online activism, storytelling, and strategy-building that set the stage for #BlackLivesMatter―and recount the spread of racial justice hashtags after the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and other high-profile incidents of killings by police. Finally, they consider hashtag created by allies, including #AllMenCan and #CrimingWhileWhite.","author":[{"family":"Jackson","given":"Sarah J."},{"family":"Bailey","given":"Moya"},{"family":"Welles","given":"Brooke Foucault"},{"family":"Lauren","given":"Genie"}],"event-place":"Cambridge","ISBN":"978-0-262-04337-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,3]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"296","publisher":"The MIT Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge","source":"Amazon","title":"#HashtagActivism: Networks of Race and Gender Justice","title-short":"#HashtagActivism","type":"book"},

The paper seeks to work away from this current disenchantment suggesting that in the field of feminist geography there are explicit intellectual and political imperatives that keep central the field of concerns associated with cultural geographical perspectives. Along the way we examine emergent scholarship on the governance of gender through culture concepts, the idea of gender as a form of foundational ordering grammar, the implications of non-representational claims for feminist scholarship, and the nature of performativity. We conclude by encouraging feminist cultural geography to chart the emergent geographies of relational natures and material cultures that reveal gender as both embodied and discursive, given and enacted.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,31]]},"author":[{"family":"JACOBS","given":"JANE M."},{"family":"NASH","given":"CATHERINE"}],"container-title":"Gender, Place & Culture","DOI":"10.1080/0966369032000114037","ISSN":"0966-369X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,9,1]]},"page":"265-279","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Too little, too much: Cultural feminist geographies","title-short":"Too little, too much","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/0966369032000114037","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"jaidkaBrevitySoulTwitter2019","abstract":"Many hoped that social networking sites would allow for the open exchange of information and a revival of the public sphere. Unfortunately, conversations on social media are often toxic and not conducive to healthy political discussions. Twitter, the most widely used social network for political discussions, doubled the limit of characters in a tweet in November 2017, which provided an opportunity to study the effect of technological affordances on political discussions using a discontinuous time series design. Using supervised and unsupervised natural language processing methods, we analyzed 358,242 tweet replies to U.S. politicians from January 2017 to March 2018. We show that doubling the permissible length of a tweet led to less uncivil, more polite, and more constructive discussions online. However, the declining trend in the empathy and respectfulness of these tweets raises concerns about the implications of the changing norms for the quality of political deliberation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Jaidka","given":"Kokil"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Alvin"},{"family":"Lelkes","given":"Yphtach"}],"container-title":"Journal of Communication","container-title-short":"J Commun","DOI":"10.1093/joc/jqz023","ISSN":"0021-9916","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"345-372","title":"Brevity is the Soul of Twitter: The Constraint Affordance and Political Discussion","title-short":"Brevity is the Soul of Twitter","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://academic.oup.com/joc/article/69/4/345/5547032","volume":"69"},
  {"id":"jaimee.settleHeritabilityPartisanAttachment2009","abstract":"One of the strongest regularities in the empirical political science literature is the well-known correlation in parent and child partisan behavior. Until recently, this phenomenon was thought to result solely from parental socialization, but new evidence on genetic sources of behavior suggests it might also be due to heritability. In this article, the authors hypothesize that genes contribute to variation in a general tendency toward strength of partisanship. Using data collected at the Twins Days Festival, the authors compare the similarity of partisan strength in identical twins who share all of their genes to the similarity of partisan strength in nonidentical twins who share only half of their genes. The results show that heritability accounts for almost half of the variance in strength of partisan attachment, suggesting we should pay closer attention to the role of biology in the expression of important political behaviors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,12]]},"author":[{"literal":"Jaime E.

While some of its services are seen as creators of a new informational economy and are hence publicly legitimized, other features are increasingly under surveillance and policed, although in reality the differences between these services is far from obvious. Our thesis is that we are currently experiencing a temporary postponement of the law, in the context of Web 2.0. Agamben’s work on the state of exception is here used to theorize the informational economy as an ongoing dispossession, under the guise of ‘networked production’. This dispossession is seen as a parallel to the concept of ‘primitive accumulation’, as a means of moving things from the exterior to the interior of the capitalist economy. This theory lets us problematize the concept of free labor, the metaphor of the enclosure, and puts into question the dichotomy between copyright and cultural commons.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Jakobsson","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Stiernstedt","given":"Fredrik"}],"container-title":"First Monday","DOI":"10.5210/fm.v15i7.2799","ISSN":"13960466","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,7,7]]},"language":"en","source":"journals.uic.edu","title":"Pirates of Silicon Valley: State of exception and dispossession in Web 2.0","title-short":"Pirates of Silicon Valley","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2799","volume":"15"},

In particular, were the 78,000 voters who gave him an Electoral College victory affected by the Russian trolls and hackers? Trump has denied it. So has Vladimir Putin. Others cast the answer as unknowable. In Cyberwar, Kathleen Hall Jamieson marshals the troll posts, unique polling data, analyses of how the press used hacked content, and a synthesis of half a century of media effects literature to argue that, although not certain, it is probable that the Russians helped elect the 45th president of the United States. In the process, she asks: How extensive was the troll messaging? What characteristics of social media did the Russians exploit? Why did the mainstream press rush the hacked content into the citizenry's newsfeeds? Was Clinton telling the truth when she alleged that the debate moderators distorted what she said in the leaked speeches? Did the Russian influence extend beyond social media and news to alter the behavior of FBI director James Comey? After detailing the ways in which Russian efforts were abetted by the press, social media, candidates, party leaders, and a polarized public, Cyberwar closes with a warning: the country is ill-prepared to prevent a sequel. In this updated paperback edition, Jamieson covers the many new developments that have come to light since the original publication.","author":[{"family":"Jamieson","given":"Kathleen Hall"}],"ISBN":"978-0-19-091582-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,24]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"337","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Cyberwar: How Russian Hackers and Trolls Helped Elect a President What We Don't, Can't, and Do Know","title-short":"Cyberwar","type":"book"},

However, scholarship dedicated to this area is lacking. Using a recent development in the field of computational network science (i.e., evolution tree analysis), this study examined this issue in the context of the 2016 US presidential election. By retrieving 307,738 tweets about 30 fake and 30 real news stories, we examined the root content, producers of original source, and evolution patterns. The findings revealed that root tweets about fake news were mostly generated by accounts from ordinary users, but they often included a link to non-credible news websites. Additionally, we observed significant differences between real and fake news stories in terms of evolution patterns. In our evolution tree analysis, tweets about real news showed wider breadth and shorter depth than tweets about fake news. The results also indicated that tweets about real news spread widely and quickly, but tweets about fake news underwent a greater number of modifications in content over the spreading process.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Jang","given":"S.

Using survey data from 442 college students in the United States, this study finds that individual characteristics and network size influence college students' expressive behavior on Facebook related to two controversial topics: gay rights issues and politics. In line with previous studies about offline political discussion, the results show that conflict avoidance and ambivalence about target issues are negatively associated with Facebook discussions. Perhaps the most interesting finding is that users who have a large number of Facebook friends are less likely to talk about politics and gay rights issues on Facebook despite having access to increasing human and information resources.

While pursuing both objectives, governments face a major challenge—to operate in a connected environment, engage stakeholders and solve societal problems by utilizing new methods, tools, practices and governance models. As result, fundamental changes are taking place on how government operates. Such changes are under the larger umbrella of ‘lean government’ (l-Government). Lean government is a new wave which is appearing as a response to traditional approaches—like electronic government (e-Government) and transformational government (t-Government), and aims at reducing the complexity of the public sector by simplifying and streamlining organizational structures and processes, at the same time at stimulating innovation by mobilizing stakeholders. In l-Government, public organizations introduce platforms facilitating innovation and interactions with other public organizations, business and citizens, and focus on their orchestration role. Experimentation, assessment and gradual improvement based on user requirements are key factors for realizing l-Government.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Janssen","given":"Marijn"},{"family":"Estevez","given":"Elsa"}],"collection-title":"ICEGOV 2011 Supplement","container-title":"Government Information Quarterly","container-title-short":"Government Information Quarterly","DOI":"10.1016/j.giq.2012.11.003","ISSN":"0740-624X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"S1-S8","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Lean government and platform-based governance—Doing more with less","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740624X12001517","volume":"30"},

  {"id":"jasserDynamicsMisinformationCascades2019","abstract":"The study of information-sharing cascades has been a constant endeavor since the emergence of social networks. Internet memes which mostly consist of catchphrases, viral images, or small videos shared over the social network are notorious for attracting the users’ attention and spreading through the web in a fast fashion. Misinformation propagators latch their message to a meme to maximize the influence and spreading of the false news. As a result, the diffusion of misleading content has become a force to be reckoned with in the field of information warfare, as foreign actors seek to change opinions, manipulate ideologies, and create conflicts. In this study, we analyze the rapid dissemination of misinformation, aka, misinformation cascades, focusing on cascade temporal behavior and multi-cascade influence relationships. Twitter data used in this study contains only information associated with the Russian Internet Agency (IRA) and the Iranian Cyber Army (ICA). Our study focuses on analyzing temporal patterns of information dynamics created by these foreign actors for the sole purpose of spreading misinformation. We explore dividing temporal cascades into phases, where each phase differs from the previous regarding the number and characteristics of the information bursts. For this preliminary study, we are focusing on the #Trump and #USA hashtags used by the ICA. By studying the dynamics behind each phase, the forces behind the transition from one phase to another, and the influence relationships between cascades and their phases, we expect to shed some light on the timely subject of how to identify and protect society from information manipulation campaigns.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Jasser","given":"Jasser"}],"container-title":"Companion Proceedings of The 2019 World Wide Web Conference","DOI":"10.1145/3308560.3314194","event":"The Web Conference 2019","event-place":"San Francisco, California, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-6675-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,17]]},"page":"33–36","publisher":"ACM","publisher-place":"San Francisco, California, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Dynamics of Misinformation Cascades","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3308560.3314194"},

  {"id":"jiaPoliticalEconomyChinese2018","abstract":"The rapid growth of the internet in China has been propelled by the Chinese government’s push to develop the country’s information infrastructure and its tight control over the internet. The most recent stage of internet development in China, however, has been driven by a three-way dynamic between the State, internet companies, and international finance capital. This relationship has yielded three internet giants—Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent—that stand at the apex of the internet economy in China. They also rival their US counterparts like Google, Facebook, and Amazon, on several key measures. We examine annual reports and other financial documents to better understand these three companies’ character as ‘capitalist enterprises’ and the tight nexus that links them to international investment banks, venture capital funds, and other foreign investors. While these processes are now fundamentally shaping ‘the Chinese internet’, they have not yet been adequately explored in the scholarly literature, we argue.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Jia","given":"Lianrui"},{"family":"Winseck","given":"Dwayne"}],"container-title":"International Communication Gazette","container-title-short":"International Communication Gazette","DOI":"10.1177/1748048517742783","ISSN":"1748-0485","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"30-59","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The political economy of Chinese internet companies: Financialization, concentration, and capitalization","title-short":"The political economy of Chinese internet companies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1748048517742783","volume":"80"},
  {"id":"jiCrisisinducedPublicDemand2019","abstract":"Through an online survey of Beijing consumer publics, this study examines a moderated mediation model of public demand for regulatory intervention ensuing from a corporate crisis that entirely unfolded on social media platforms. The study finds that highly involved publics tend to attribute crisis responsibility more to the in-crisis company, and such attribution leads to stronger demand for regulatory intervention. However, the effects of issue involvement on public demands decrease when publics think they have collective efficacy to control crisis outcomes and that government has controllability over crisis outcomes. The study further finds that, in determining the degree of public demand, how publics attribute crisis responsibility is not as important as how they perceive government controllability. By delineating the relationships among issue involvement, responsibility attribution, perceived government controllability, and collective efficacy, this study outlines a comprehensive psychological mechanism of public demand for regulatory intervention during corporate crisis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Ji","given":"Yingru"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Sora"}],"container-title":"New Media & Society","container-title-short":"New Media & Society","DOI":"10.1177/1461444819874473","ISSN":"1461-4448, 1461-7315","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,11]]},"language":"en","page":"146144481987447","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Crisis-induced public demand for regulatory intervention in the social media era: Examining the moderating roles of perceived government controllability and consumer collective efficacy","title-short":"Crisis-induced public demand for regulatory intervention in the social media era","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1461444819874473"},

Based on critical mass theory and with the help of a hand-collected panel dataset of 151 listed German ﬁrms for the years 2000–2005, we explore whether the link between gender diversity and ﬁrm performance follows a U-shape. Controlling for reversed causality, we ﬁnd evidence for gender diversity to at ﬁrst negatively affect ﬁrm performance and—only after a ‘‘critical mass’’ of about 30 % women has been reached—to be associated with higher ﬁrm performance than completely male boards. Given our sample ﬁrms, the critical mass of 30 % women translates into an absolute number of about three women on the board and hence supports recent studies on a corresponding ‘‘magic number’’ of women in the boardroom.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Joecks","given":"Jasmin"},{"family":"Pull","given":"Kerstin"},{"family":"Vetter","given":"Karin"}],"container-title":"Journal of Business Ethics","DOI":"10.1007/s10551-012-1553-6","ISSN":"0167-4544, 1573-0697","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,11]]},"language":"en","page":"61-72","source":"Crossref","title":"Gender Diversity in the Boardroom and Firm Performance: What Exactly Constitutes a “Critical Mass?”","title-short":"Gender Diversity in the Boardroom and Firm Performance","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-012-1553-6","volume":"118"},

Based on a Danish study, the article argues that in relation to Facebook, user consent de facto served as the price for participating and for gaining access to a social infrastructure. The article opens with a brief introduction to privacy as a human right, followed by a discussion of some of the critique that has been raised towards social media platforms vis-à-vis the right to privacy. Second, it presents the findings from a study conducted amongst 68 Danish high school students in October 2013 concerning their privacy perceptions and practices when using social media platforms.

  {"id":"johnsFeelingChillBersih2019","abstract":"In 2007, Bersih—a Malaysian social movement for “clean and fair elections”—rode a wave of anti-government sentiment to mobilize 40,000 citizens to take to the streets. In particular, young Malaysians, fueled by “outrage and hope” at old oligarchies and lives put on hold by economic, social, and political inequality, were key actors in Bersih rallies staged between 2011 and 2016, driven by social media platforms and networked publics, which enabled the enthusiasm of the streets to connect with and drive the movement’s online formation. In response, the then government began to use media and security laws to disrupt digital networks and engage in arrest of activists and “ordinary” citizens. This, combined with allegations that the government has used astroturfing (commonly referred to as “cybertrooping” in Malaysia) to shape voter sentiments and suppress the momentum of Bersih and popular forms of online political dissent, has been strongly condemned by human rights organizations. This article draws upon findings from PhD research on cybertroopers and ethnographic interviews conducted with 29 Malaysian-Chinese youth between 2016 and 2018 (in Kuala Lumpur and Melbourne, Australia) to map and analyze the effects of the government’s use of “affective techniques” to manipulate social media publics and crackdown on online political communication, with media reports connecting these strategies to declining participation in Bersih’s street rallies from Bersih 4-5. The article will draw on theories of “networked affect” and “affective publics” to examine the role affect has played in this downturn in participation and a growing sense of hopelessness among Malaysia’s digital citizens.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Johns","given":"Amelia"},{"family":"Cheong","given":"Niki"}],"container-title":"Social Media + Society","container-title-short":"Social Media + Society","DOI":"10.1177/2056305118821801","ISSN":"2056-3051, 2056-3051","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,1]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Feeling the Chill: Bersih 2.0, State Censorship, and “Networked Affect” on Malaysian Social Media 2012–2018","title-short":"Feeling the Chill","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/2056305118821801","volume":"5"},

We provide detailed historical evidence that supports our prediction that rulers abandoned the competitive allocation of tax rights in favor of cabal tax farming in order to gain access to inside credit, and that this transition was accompanied by investments in standardization. Finally (iv) we show why this intermediate institution proved to be self-undermining in England, where it was quickly replaced by direct collection, but lasted in France until the French Revolution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Johnson","given":"Noel D."},{"family":"Koyama","given":"Mark"}],"container-title":"Explorations in Economic History","DOI":"10.1016/j.eeh.2013.07.005","ISSN":"00144983","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1-20","source":"Crossref","title":"Tax farming and the origins of state capacity in England and France","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0014498313000326","volume":"51"},

There has long been speculation that the countries adopting English common law are better at providing legal dispute resolution than those adopting the continental forms of civil law. That speculative assessment is found to be true only in those countries that have been colonized, further analysis demonstrates that it is the effectiveness of the protection of property rights in common law systems rather than the institutions themselves that influence rule of law statistics.

A social science explanation is proposed to better understand the antecedents and consequences of police violence. A major strength of the articles in this volume is their delineation of causes of police violence and their consequences. The underlying and recurring explanation for police violence is stereotypical racial attitudes and their behavioral consequences. Effects of police violence extend beyond immediate victims to include communities of color. Comparisons with European police suggest that while lethal actions by police in Europe are far fewer, patterns of brutality and its justification mirror the U.S. context. The problem of police violence against persons of color is multidimensional and complex. This article concludes that there is no easy overarching solution or “fix” to this violence. Rather, each facet must be carefully examined—as this volume has done—and approaches focused on causes and consequences of specific problems should be developed and pursued.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Jones","given":"James M."}],"container-title":"Journal of Social Issues","DOI":"10.1111/josi.12252","ISSN":"1540-4560","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","page":"872-883","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Killing Fields: Explaining Police Violence against Persons of Color","title-short":"Killing Fields","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/josi.12252","volume":"73"},

  {"id":"jorgensenHumanRightsAge2019","abstract":"Today such companies as Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Twitter play an increasingly important role in how users form and express opinions, encounter information, debate, disagree, mobilize, and maintain their privacy. What are the human rights implications of an online domain managed by privately owned platforms? According to the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, adopted by the UN Human Right Council in 2011, businesses have a responsibility to respect human rights and to carry out human rights due diligence. But this goal is dependent on the willingness of states to encode such norms into business regulations and of companies to comply. In this volume, contributors from across law and internet and media studies examine the state of human rights in today's platform society.\n\nThe contributors consider the “datafication” of society, including the economic model of data extraction and the conceptualization of privacy. They examine online advertising, content moderation, corporate storytelling around human rights, and other platform practices. Finally, they discuss the relationship between human rights law and private actors, addressing such issues as private companies' human rights responsibilities and content regulation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,1]]},"editor":[{"family":"Jørgensen","given":"Rikke Frank"}],"ISBN":"978-0-262-03905-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,11]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"392","publisher":"The MIT Press","title":"Human Rights in the Age of Platforms","type":"book","URL":"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/human-rights-age-platforms"},
  {"id":"jorgensenHumanRightsGlobal2006","abstract":"International organizations, governments, academia, industry, and the media have all begun to grapple with the information society as a global policy issue. The first United Nations World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), held in December 2003, recognized the connections between information technology and human rights with a Declaration of Principles--in effect, the first \"constitution\" for cyberspace--that called for the development of the information society to conform to recognized standards of human rights. Critical issues in the policy debates around WSIS have been the so-called digital divide, which reflects a knowledge divide, a social divide, and an economic divide; and the need for a nondiscriminatory information society to provide universal access to information technology in local languages throughout the developing world. Other crucial issues include the regulatory frameworks for information access and ownership and such basic freedoms as the right to privacy. The contributors to this timely volume examine the links between information technology and human rights from a range of disciplinary perspectives. Scholars, human rights activists, and practitioners discuss such topics as freedom of expression, access to information, privacy, discrimination, gender equality, intellectual property, political participation, and freedom of assembly in the context of the revolution in information and communication technology, exploring the ways in which the information society can either advance human rights around the world or threaten them. An afterword reports on the November 2005 WSIS, held in Tunis, and its reaffirmation of the fundamental role of human rights in the global information society.

I present three major theoretical dimensions of the intersection of urban space, social inequality and social difference: (a) urban space as inscribed by boundaries and reflective of patterns of social difference and inequality; (b) urban space as a site and object of struggle between social groups; and (c) urban space as a vehicle for social reproduction through the logic of its universe.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Joseph","given":"Lauren"}],"container-title":"Spaces for Difference: An Interdisciplinary Journal","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,12,1]]},"language":"en","source":"escholarship.org","title":"Finding Space Beyond Variables: An Analytical Review of Urban Space and Social Inequalities","title-short":"Finding Space Beyond Variables","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3tz160nq","volume":"1"},

This essay argues that the boundaries between the civil rights and Black Power eras have been too sharply drawn at the expense of a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of both periods. Civil rights and Black Power are rooted in distinct, yet overlapping origins that share a common history.

  {"id":"jouvenelChairmanProblem1961","abstract":"One of the major obstacles to the progress of political theory lies in the fact that people speak of rights without paying attention to the feasibility of their exercise. I propose to raise here some elementary problems relating to the right of speech. It is one of the basic tenets of our democratic political philosophy that all people (over a given age) have an equal right of speech. Making this right operational however gives rise to difficulties which have not been faced.I shall start out with a very simple problem, which moreover has the advantage of evoking familiar pictures: this is the chairman's problem. I find myself chairman of an assembly, and regard all participants as formally equal, which commits me to treating them equally. Feeling bound by this principle, I decide as follows: the duration of the meeting is m, the number of participants n: I shall give the floor to each participant for a time m/n; thus the equal right of speech will receive practical application. Assume that the meeting is to be crowned by a vote (the time of actual voting not figuring in m): before the participants cast their equal votes, they will have had equal opportunities to influence the voting, i.e., they shall have had, insofar as depends upon me, equal voices.Now if m the duration of the meeting (in speaking time) is three hours, and if n the number of participants is 12, my procedure is susceptible of being applied: it grants the floor to each participant for a quarter of an hour. This is not a long time but still it may be enough.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Jouvenel","given":"Bertrand","dropping-particle":"de"}],"container-title":"American Political Science Review","DOI":"10.1017/S0003055400123391","ISSN":"0003-0554, 1537-5943","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1961,6]]},"language":"en","page":"368-372","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"The Chairman's Problem","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/chairmans-problem/042FECBDF565AE9B5EACFB3DBC541624","volume":"55"},

Ten interviews with journalists working for nine different news organisations in four different countries were conducted in 2017. The interviews were recorded and transcribed by the author. Fundamentally different practices such as hashtagging and the outsourcing of content moderation are explored in relation to each other and to the news outlets’ practice of managing comments sections online. The study shows that the practices in which news organisations and individuals engage are entangled and overlap, creating an infrastructure for managing online misconduct. This study has attempted to shift the focus from the actors to the practices they engage in and demonstrate how practices can bring about structural change to a network and generate new actors who start to engage in the reproduction and adjustment of the practices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Juneström","given":"Amalia"}],"genre":"text","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,15]]},"language":"en","title":"Online user misconduct and an evolving infrastructure of practices: a practice-based study of information infrastructure and social practices","title-short":"Online user misconduct and an evolving infrastructure of practices","type":"webpage","URL":"http://informationr.net/ir/24-1/isic2018/isic1825.html"},

  {"id":"jurgensPowerDefaultReddit2017","abstract":"Information intermediaries like search engines and social networks can represent a source of bias for recipients. Their algorithms, especially concerning filtering, sorting, and personalization, are assumed to skew the representation of news topics and thus create media effects in their own right. Largely as a result of methodological challenges, existing studies have often tested isolated hypotheses without covering the full effects chain from content production to reception by the user. However, the preselection of content performed by intermediaries is only relevant if users choose to rely on it, an assumption that so far lacks broad empirical evidence. Based on a broad review of existing study designs, this article develops a general intermediary effects model. From this model, researchers can derive empirical study designs that capture and differentiate the individual effects of filtering, sorting, and personalization. We then apply the model in an assessment of the news aggregator Reddit's change in capacity to influence its users’ information selection. Using counterfactual time series decomposition, we show that changing the sections of the website included in the start page by default can lead to large changes in attention paid to content. These findings substantiate existing assumptions about the power of information intermediaries to shape the information environments of their users.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Jürgens","given":"Pascal"},{"family":"Stark","given":"Birgit"}],"container-title":"Policy & Internet","DOI":"10.1002/poi3.166","ISSN":"1944-2866","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","page":"395-419","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The Power of Default on Reddit: A General Model to Measure the Influence of Information Intermediaries","title-short":"The Power of Default on Reddit","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/poi3.166","volume":"9"},

Theoretically, it builds on (co-)evolutionary innovation studies in order to adequately grasp the interplay of technological and societal change and combines these with institutional approaches to incorporate governance by technology or rather software as institutions. Methodologically, it draws from an empirical survey of Internet-based services that rely on automated algorithmic selection, a functional typology derived from it, and an analysis of associated potential social risks. It shows how algorithmic selection has become a growing source of social order, of a shared social reality in information societies. It argues that – similar to the construction of realities by traditional mass media – automated algorithmic selection applications shape daily lives and realities, affect the perception of the world, and influence behavior. However, the co-evolutionary perspective on algorithms as institutions, ideologies, intermediaries, and actors highlights differences that are to be found, first, in the growing personalization of constructed realities and, second, in the constellation of involved actors. Altogether, compared to reality construction by traditional mass media, algorithmic reality construction tends to increase individualization, commercialization, inequalities, and deterritorialization and to decrease transparency, controllability, and predictability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Just","given":"Natascha"},{"family":"Latzer","given":"Michael"}],"container-title":"Media, Culture & Society","container-title-short":"Media, Culture & Society","DOI":"10.1177/0163443716643157","ISSN":"0163-4437","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"238-258","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Governance by algorithms: reality construction by algorithmic selection on the Internet","title-short":"Governance by algorithms","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0163443716643157","volume":"39"},

  {"id":"kaganWhenImmigrantsSpeak","abstract":"Although many unauthorized immigrants have become politically active in campaigning for immigration reform, their ability to speak out publicly may depend more on political discretion than on the constitutional protections that citizens normally take for granted. Potential threats to immigrant free speech may be seen in three areas of law. First, the Department of Justice has made a broad claim that immigrants who have not been legally admitted to the country have no First Amendment protection at all. Second, the Supreme Court has approved broad prohibitions on non-citizens spending money on speech that is related to electoral campaigns. Third, the Court has indicated that the federal government might, in its discretion, act to deport immigrants because of their political activities. The Supreme Court should revisit these questions because current case law is in tension with other principles of free speech law, especially the prohibition on identity-based speech restrictions as articulated in Citizens United v. FEC. As the Court explained, the First Amendment protects the rights of marginalized people to have a voice and does not allow the government to prefer some speakers over others based on their identity.","author":[{"family":"Kagan","given":"Michael"}],"language":"en","page":"51","source":"Zotero","title":"When Immigrants Speak: The Precarious Status of Non-Citizen Speech Under the First Amendment","type":"article-journal","volume":"57"},

Our findings reveal that FD and ID activity relate to political engagement, but in different ways. In addition, we find that the size of young people’s social networks interacts with both FD and ID online activity to promote political activity. This indicates that having exposure to “weak-ties” (resulting from large social networks) promote higher levels of political engagement. These findings demonstrate the need to specify the kinds of online activities in which youth are engaged and, more broadly, the political significance of social media and social networks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Kahne","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Bowyer","given":"Benjamin"}],"container-title":"Political Communication","DOI":"10.1080/10584609.2018.1426662","ISSN":"1058-4609, 1091-7675","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,3]]},"language":"en","page":"470-493","source":"Crossref","title":"The Political Significance of Social Media Activity and Social Networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10584609.2018.1426662","volume":"35"},

  {"id":"kalmarTwitterGabRacism2018","abstract":"With pressure on Twitter from governments and others intent on preventing the spread of racist, including anti-Semitic and Islamophobic, messages, it appears that some right-wing populist users have moved to Gab, where they are less likely to be censored. There appears to be a split between those who are willing to play by the new rules on Twitter, and those who prefer the ability to express their racism more openly on Gab. We believe that this split reflects a broader, ongoing split within the far right. In the United States and in Europe, the more \"moderate\" right, hopeful of electoral successes, conserves its Islamophobic and anti-migrant rhetoric, but is moving away from overt anti-Semitism. Meantime the diehard anti-Semites develop their own, separate networks, online and offline, and these may now include Gab. Our test case is what we call the \"Soros Myth,\" which accuses the Hungarian-born, American-Jewish financier George Soros of instigating or supporting an astonishingly large array of causes and events that right-wing populist resent, including the mass migration of Muslim refugees to Europe. The article discusses the methodology of gathering relevant information on Twitter and Gab, and the preliminary results, which strongly support our working hypothesis that when it comes to the Soros Myth, the more overtly anti-Semitic content is now found on Gab.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Kalmar","given":"Ivan"},{"family":"Stevens","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Worby","given":"Nicholas"}],"collection-title":"SMSociety '18","container-title":"Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Social Media and Society","DOI":"10.1145/3217804.3217939","event-place":"Copenhagen, Denmark","ISBN":"978-1-4503-6334-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,18]]},"page":"330–334","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"Copenhagen, Denmark","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Twitter, Gab, and Racism: The Case of the Soros Myth","title-short":"Twitter, Gab, and Racism","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://doi.org/10.1145/3217804.3217939"},

  {"id":"karanasiouLawEncodedFree2016","abstract":"The free exchange of data between many interconnected nodes, in the absence of a central point of control, has been at the heart of the Internet’s architecture since its inception. For its engineering architects “if the Web was to be a universal resource, it had to grow in an unlimited way”, thus “its being ‘out of control’ was very important” (Berners-Lee and Fischetti, 1999). Yet, this simple deign choice has had a serious impact on conventional legal thinking. This paper highlights the importance of online decentralized architecture as the perfect substantiation of the autonomy rational underpinning the right to free speech.In doing so the paper analyses the core principles supporting the Internet’s architecture on their merit to the promote the user’s autonomy and self-realisation through speech. Following the free speech rationale for autonomy, it is observed how some simple engineering decisions for an open decentralised communicatory platform can build a user-centric ecology for speech. To validate this hypothesis two main architectural choices are examined as to the potential they hold for free speech: the principles of Modularity and End-to-End (E2E).The paper concludes that in terms of free speech, law and net architecture should be seen as complementing factors instead of opposite controlling deities. In this respect, Lessig’s mantra that “code is law” is paraphrased to read as “law encoded”, meaning that the law should strive to maintain the core architectural Internet values promoting human rights, and free speech in particular.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Karanasiou","given":"Argyro P."}],"container-title":"First Monday","DOI":"10.5210/fm.v21i12.7118","ISSN":"13960466","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,11,20]]},"language":"en","source":"journals.uic.edu","title":"Law encoded: Towards a free speech policy model based on decentralized architectures","title-short":"Law encoded","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/7118","volume":"21"},

  {"id":"karpfAnalyticActivismDigital2016","abstract":"Among the ways that digital media has transformed political activism, the most remarkable is not that new media allows disorganized masses to speak, but that it enables organized activist groups to listen. Beneath the waves of e-petitions, \"likes,\" and hashtags lies a sea of data - a newly quantified form of supporter sentiment - and advocacy organizations can now utilize new tools to measure this data to make decisions and shape campaigns. In this book, David Karpf discusses the power and potential of this new \"analytic activism,\" exploring the organizational and media logics that determine how digital inputs shape the choices that political campaigners make. He provides the first careful analysis of how organizations like Change.org and Upworthy.com influence the types of political narratives that dominate our Facebook newsfeeds and Twitter timelines, and how MoveOn.org and its \"netroots\" peers use analytics to listen more effectively to their members and supporters. As well, he identifies the boundaries that define the scope of this new style of organized citizen engagement. But also raising a note of caution, Karpf identifies the dangers and limitations in putting too much faith in these new forms of organized listening.","author":[{"family":"Karpf","given":"David"}],"collection-title":"Oxford Studies in Digital Politics","ISBN":"978-0-19-026615-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,11,1]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"228","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Analytic Activism: Digital Listening and the New Political Strategy","title-short":"Analytic Activism","type":"book"},

  {"id":"karpfMoveOnEffectUnexpected2012","abstract":"The Internet is facilitating a generational transition within America's advocacy group system. New \"netroots\" political associations have arisen in the past decade and play an increasingly prominent role in citizen political mobilization. At the same time, the organizations that mediate citizen political engagement and sustained collective action are changing. They rely upon modified staff structures and work routines. They employ novel strategies and tactical repertoires. Rather than \"organizing without organizations,\" the new media environment has given rise to \"organizing through different organizations.\" The MoveOn Effect provides a richly detailed analysis of this disruptive transformation. It highlights changes in membership and fundraising regimes - established industrial patterns of supporter interaction and revenue streams - that were pioneered by MoveOn.org and have spread broadly within the advocacy system. Through interviews, content analysis, and direct observation of the leading netroots organizations, the book offers fresh insights into 21st century political organizing. The book highlights important variations among the new organizations - including internet-mediated issue generalists like MoveOn, community blogs like DailyKos.com, and neo-federated groups like DemocracyforAmerica.com. It also explores a wider set of netroots infrastructure organizations that provide supporting services to membership-based advocacy associations. The rise of the political netroots has had a distinctly partisan character: conservatives have repeatedly tried and failed to build equivalents to the organizations and infrastructure of the progressive netroots. The MoveOn Effect investigates these efforts, as well as the late-forming Tea Party movement, and introduces the theory of Outparty Innovation Incentives as an explanation for the partisan adoption of political technology. Written by a political scientist who is also a longtime political organizer, The MoveOn Effect offers a widely-accessible account of the Internet's impact on American politics. Operating at the intersection of practitioner and academic knowledge-traditions, Karpf provides a reassessment of many longstanding claims about new media and citizen political engagement.","author":[{"family":"Karpf","given":"David"}],"collection-title":"Oxford Studies in Digital Politics","ISBN":"978-0-19-989838-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,5,29]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"255","publisher":"Oxford University Press, USA","source":"Google Books","title":"The MoveOn Effect: The Unexpected Transformation of American Political Advocacy","title-short":"The MoveOn Effect","type":"book"},

  {"id":"katoSTRENGTHENINGWEAKSTATE2012","abstract":"This essay charts the development of the American state during the era when Southern lynchings prevailed. Contrary to the standard interpretation that depicts the American state as having lacked the administrative and legal capacity to protect the lives of Southern Blacks, it is a more pluralist conception of state weakness for which I argue, one that characterizes the American state's behavior regarding racial violence as the deliberate, calculated act of an active state choosing not to act. The state had always possessed legal authority to prosecute lynch mobs, but the key determinant was garnering the political will to enforce the law. Examples gleaned from the Ulysses S. Grant, Franklin Roosevelt (FDR), and Lyndon Johnson (LBJ) administrations illustrate the American government's political vacillation between acting and not acting. Examinations of two Supreme Court cases in 1966 highlight the political nature of federal rights enforcement. In light of the 1966 Supreme Court decisions in United States v. Price and United States v. Guest, the Court appears never to have repudiated or stripped the federal government of all of its authority to engage in combating racial violence. Even though the Court clearly signaled during Reconstruction that it was not going to uphold claims of rights violations of Blacks in the South, it did so without ever making a substantive decision on whether it could. Sections 241 and 242 of Title 18 of the United States Code were, in effect, placed into suspended animation; it was only when there was a political will to reengage with federal rights enforcement that the Court resuscitated these laws. In the parlance of the weak state thesis, the American state did not lose its capacity to combat racial violence; rather it simply chose not to engage.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Kato","given":"Daniel"}],"container-title":"Du Bois Review: Social Science Research on Race","DOI":"10.1017/S1742058X12000306","ISSN":"1742-058X, 1742-0598","issue":"2","issued":{"literal":"2012/ed"},"language":"en","page":"457-480","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"STRENGTHENING THE WEAK STATE: Politicizing the American State's “Weakness” on Racial Violence","title-short":"STRENGTHENING THE WEAK STATE","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/du-bois-review-social-science-research-on-race/article/strengthening-the-weak-state/0F53AE5C106E1A90D13816D9F7BF41B4","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"kellerCJEUNewFiltering2019","abstract":"For several years now, one of the most hotly contested Internet policy questions in the European Union (EU) has been whether and how platforms like YouTube or Twitter can be required to proactively monitor their users’ posts in search of illegal content. Proposals for platforms to monitor user behavior by deploying technological filters were at the heart of the EU Copyright Directive, which passed into law in 2019; as well as the Terrorist Content Regulation, which is now in the final stages of negotiation. Filters are likely to be central to the coming years’ debates about the pending Digital Services Act, and to discussion of potential changes to the eCommerce Directive, which has structured platforms’ legal responsibility for user content in the EU for almost two decades.\n\nA case decided by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in October, Glawischnig-Piesczek v. Facebook Ireland, was widely expected to shed light on the subject of filtering requirements. It did shed light, but only a little. The Court discussed legislative rules that govern filtering under eCommerce Directive Article 15, but not the fundamental rights rules that legislators and Member State courts must apply under the EU Charter. The legal conclusions it reached will complicate fundamental rights analysis and legal paths forward for both “pro-filtering” and “anti-filtering” advocates in the evolving legislative debate. This blog post will briefly discuss the ruling’s relevance for future EU legislation, and in particular for the Terrorist Content Regulation. It builds on the much deeper analysis in Dolphins in the Net, my Stanford CIS White Paper about the Glawischnig-Piesczek AG Opinion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Keller","given":"Daphne"}],"container-title":"Center for Internet and Society","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,2]]},"language":"en","title":"The CJEU’s new filtering case, the Terrorist Content Regulation, and the future of filtering mandates in the EU","type":"post-weblog","URL":"http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2019/12/cjeu’s-new-filtering-case-terrorist-content-regulation-and-future-filtering-mandates-eu"},

  {"id":"kellerFilteringFacebookIntroducing2019","abstract":"Summer is winding down, and policymakers in Brussels are returning to an ambitious task: drafting new regulation for the Internet. Meanwhile, in Luxembourg, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) is deciding cases that will affect both Internet platforms’ operations and lawmakers’ choices in devising new laws. One case in particular, Glawischnig-Piesczek v. Facebook Ireland, has had surprisingly little attention, given how consequential it is likely to be. It calls on the Court to address the question at the heart of an ongoing political debate: whether and how EU Member States can require platforms to use automated filters in an attempt to detect and delete prohibited material in users’ posts.\n\nThe Court’s Judgment will, at minimum, interpret relevant provisions in the EU’s main existing Intermediary Liability law, the eCommerce Directive. It will almost certainly also tell courts – and lawmakers – something about more permanent limitations on state-backed filtering mandates, based on Internet users’ fundamental rights under the EU Charter. The case also raises a question, analogous to the one in Google’s pending “Right to Be Forgotten” case, about national courts’ power to order global takedown of expression or information that is legal in other countries.\n\nThe Opinion in Glawischnig-Piesczek by the Court’s Advocate General (AG) proposes unprecedented and troubling answers to all of these questions. If the Court follows his recommendations, it will likely disrupt both legislative agendas and the evolving human rights-based guidance about Internet content filters.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Keller","given":"Daphne"}],"container-title":"Center for Internet and Society","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,5]]},"language":"en","title":"Filtering Facebook: Introducing Dolphins in the Net, a New Stanford CIS White Paper - OR - Why Internet Users and EU Policymakers Should Worry about the Advocate General’s Opinion in Glawischnig-Piesczek","title-short":"Filtering Facebook","type":"post-weblog","URL":"http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2019/09/filtering-facebook-introducing-dolphins-net-new-stanford-cis-white-paper-or-why"},

I described several ambitious regulatory models for doing that in my recent paper, Who Do You Sue? State and Platform Hybrid Power Over Online Speech. This blog post excerpts that discussion, and sketches out potential legal regimes to address major platforms’ function as de facto gatekeepers of online speech and information. Readers I’ve talked to so far have expressed particular interest in the Magic API's model, which speaks to both speech and competition concerns.\n\nOf course, lawmakers’ options are simpler if their only goal is to make platforms take down more user-generated content. A clumsy law like FOSTA can achieve that goal easily – at the cost of driving a great deal of legal speech offline. I outlined more nuanced options for lawmakers purely pursuing takedown goals in this White Paper, and will offer a shorter rundown of available doctrinal “dials and knobs” in a piece coming out soon from Yale ISP.\n\nThe ideas outlined here assume that lawmakers want to shape platform behavior more broadly – including by constraining their discretionary power to take down users’ lawful speech under Terms of Service or Community Guidelines. I refer to arguments that platforms can be compelled to carry content against their will as “must carry” claims. Much of the paper is devoted to the likely Constitutional barriers to such claims or laws. This section also builds on discussions about exactly which speech and exactly which platform operations, including content ranking or amplification, might be affected by must-carry rules.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Keller","given":"Daphne"}],"container-title":"Center for Internet and Society","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,6]]},"language":"en","title":"Platform Content Regulation – Some Models and Their Problems","type":"post-weblog","URL":"http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2019/05/platform-content-regulation-%E2%80%93-some-models-and-their-problems"},
  {"id":"kellerPoliticalAstroturfingTwitter2020","abstract":"Political astroturfing, a centrally coordinated disinformation campaign in which participants pretend to be ordinary citizens acting independently, has the potential to influence electoral outcomes and other forms of political behavior. Yet, it is hard to evaluate the scope and effectiveness of political astroturfing without “ground truth” information, such as the verified identity of its agents and instigators. In this paper, we study the South Korean National Information Service’s (NIS) disinformation campaign during the presidential election in 2012, taking advantage of a list of participating accounts published in court proceedings. Features that best distinguish these accounts from regular users in contemporaneously collected Twitter data are traces left by coordination among astroturfing agents, instead of the individual account characteristics typically used in related approaches such as social bot detection. We develop a methodology that exploits these distinct empirical patterns to identify additional likely astroturfing accounts and validate this detection strategy by analyzing their messages and current account status. However, an analysis relying on Twitter influence metrics shows that the known and suspect NIS accounts only had a limited impact on political social media discussions. By using the principal-agent framework to analyze one of the earliest revealed instances of political astroturfing, we improve on extant methodological approaches to detect disinformation campaigns and ground them more firmly in social science theory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Keller","given":"Franziska B."},{"family":"Schoch","given":"David"},{"family":"Stier","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Yang","given":"JungHwan"}],"container-title":"Political Communication","DOI":"10.1080/10584609.2019.1661888","ISSN":"1058-4609","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,3]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/10584609.2019.1661888","page":"256-280","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Political Astroturfing on Twitter: How to Coordinate a Disinformation Campaign","title-short":"Political Astroturfing on Twitter","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10584609.2019.1661888","volume":"37"},

  {"id":"kemberDoesUseStudent2002","abstract":"An investigation was conducted into 3- or 4-year departmental sets of student feedback questionnaire data from one university. Only four out of 25 departments had significant changes to any of the six dimensions in the 3- or 4-year period, and three of these significant changes were falls. There is, therefore, no evidence that the use of the questionnaire was making any contribution to improving the overall quality of teaching and learning of the departments, at least as perceived by the students. If it was, there should have been evidence of rising values. The following reasons why the use of the questionnaire might not have been conducive to improving teaching quality are discussed. The possibility that teaching quality is inherently stable is rejected. It is possible that feedback from the questionnaire was not used effectively. Related to this is whether instructors perceived that the university rewarded good teaching, so felt there was an incentive to make use of the feedback. The emphasis of the system was on appraisal, which might negate any developmental effect. The standard questionnaire and the associated procedures may have lacked flexibility and been inappropriate for innovative forms of teaching. The study questions whether student feedback questionnaires are utilising resources effectively if they are administered in an environment similar to the university in question, which appears reasonably typical.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Kember","given":"David"},{"family":"Leung","given":"Doris Y.

Some claim so-called merit judicial selection systems are superior because they bypass voters who discriminate and constrain appointers, thereby eliminating politics and bias from the selection process. Social science research, however, shows that merit systems are not better than elective systems in producing a diverse and representative bench. The evidence shows no systemic effect. The systems with the highest numbers of women judges are civil law systems that recruit judges to the career civil service by examination. The common law jurisdictions that enjoy the greatest increases in the numbers of women judges serving have made the gender diversity of the bench a clear priority and set goals, rid the system of indirectly discriminatory standards, trained selectors about the dangers of implicit bias, and actively recruited women. Alternatively, a particular governor, president, or prime minister with the power to appoint judges has made a diverse and representative judiciary a priority and chosen women and minority men accordingly. Even the best systems have substantial room to improve. After examining the many explanations for women’s under representation, I review the evidence on systemic effects in the American states. I then look at three jurisdictions that have made impressive progress in increasing the number of women judges serving—Ontario, Scotland, and South Africa—to discover the ingredients of their successes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Kenney","given":"Sally"}],"container-title":"SSRN Electronic Journal","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.3324661","ISSN":"1556-5068","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"language":"en","source":"Crossref","title":"Which Judicial Selection Systems Generate the Most Women Judges?

  {"id":"kerrWhyCourtsShould2011","abstract":"Probable cause is one of the fundamental concepts of Fourth Amendment law, but the Supreme Court has refused to quantify it. The Court has described probable cause as a \"fair probability,\" but it has declined to explain just how likely a \"fair\" probability might be. Does a \"fair probability\" mean a 50% likelihood? A 40% likelihood? And why won't the Justices say? Are they just afraid of math? This essay argues that courts should not quantify probable cause because quantification would produce less accurate probable cause determinations. The core problem is that information critical to probable cause is often left out of affidavits in support of warrants: Although affidavits say what techniques police tried that added to cause, they generally leave out both what the police tried that did not add to cause and what techniques the police never tried. Determining probable cause accurately often requires this information, however. By leaving probable cause unquantified, current law enables judges to use their intuition and situation-sense to recognize when missing information is likely important to assessing probable cause. Quantification would lead to less accurate probable cause determinations by disabling those intuitions, creating the false impression that the information provided in the affidavit is the only relevant information. Cognitive biases such as the representativeness heuristic and anchoring effects would allow the government to create the false impression that a low-probability event was actually a high-probability event. To ensure accurate probable cause determinations, then, probable cause should remain unquantified. The result is counter-intuitive but true: Knowing less about probable cause improves how the standard is applied.","author":[{"family":"Kerr","given":"Orin S."}],"event-place":"Rochester, NY","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"publisher":"Social Science Research Network","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","title":"Why Courts Should Not Quantify Probable Cause","title-short":"Why Courts Should Not Quantify Probable Cause","type":"report","URL":"http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1797824"},

  {"id":"kertzerDecomposingAudienceCosts2016","abstract":"According to a growing tradition in International Relations, one way governments can credibly signal their intentions in foreign policy crises is by creating domestic audience costs: leaders can tie their hands by publicly threatening to use force since domestic publics punish leaders who say one thing and do another. We argue here that there are actually two logics of audience costs: audiences can punish leaders both for being inconsistent (the traditional audience cost), and for threatening to use force in the first place (a belligerence cost). We employ an experiment that disentangles these two rationales, and turn to a series of dispositional characteristics from political psychology to bring the audience into audience cost theory. Our results suggest that traditional audience cost experiments may overestimate how much people care about inconsistency, and that the logic of audience costs (and the implications for crisis bargaining) varies considerably with the leader's constituency.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Kertzer","given":"Joshua D."},{"family":"Brutger","given":"Ryan"}],"container-title":"American Journal of Political Science","DOI":"10.1111/ajps.12201","ISSN":"1540-5907","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ajps.12201","page":"234-249","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Decomposing Audience Costs: Bringing the Audience Back into Audience Cost Theory","title-short":"Decomposing Audience Costs","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajps.12201","volume":"60"},

Arguing against this sympathetic position on the other side of the debate are the sceptics, who have raised troubling questions about dignity’s alleged indeterminacy, as well as about the illiberal role that it has allegedly played in certain contexts. In this article, I argue that designing a defensible and useful conception of dignity which is distinguishable from other values such as equality and autonomy may be possible, but not without addressing some genuine infirmities that the critics have pointed out. If there is indeed such a defensible conception of dignity, it is likely to be ‘expressive’ in character. I therefore argue that the legal ideal of dignity is best understood as an expressive norm: whether an act disrespects someone’s dignity depends on the meaning that such act expresses, rather than its consequences or any other attribute of that act.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Khaitan","given":"T."}],"container-title":"Oxford Journal of Legal Studies","DOI":"10.1093/ojls/gqr024","ISSN":"0143-6503, 1464-3820","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1-19","source":"Crossref","title":"Dignity as an Expressive Norm: Neither Vacuous Nor a Panacea","title-short":"Dignity as an Expressive Norm","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/ojls/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/ojls/gqr024","volume":"32"},

  {"id":"khanCriticalRepublicanismJurgen2013","abstract":"Jürgen Habermas's theory of 'discourse ethics' has been an important source of inspiration for theories of deliberative democracy and is typically contrasted with agonistic conceptions of democracy represented by theorists such as Chantal Mouffe. In this article I show that this contrast is overstated. By focusing on the different philosophical traditions that underpin Mouffe's and Habermas's respective approaches, commentators have generally overlooked the political similarities between these thinkers. I examine Habermas's and Mouffe's respective conceptions of democratic politics and argue that they cannot be so neatly distinguished from each other. I show that much of Mouffe's criticism of Habermas's theory does not hold up to careful scrutiny, and discourse ethics shares important points of similarity with her own democratic theory. By using critical republican theory to show the similarities in their work, I push beyond the agonistic versus deliberative debate, and show that at the heart of both of these approaches is a critical republican emphasis on the need for civic solidarity, on the constructive role of conflict in democratic politics and on the vital importance of self-government. These are crucial ingredients for the regeneration of democracy in contemporary pluralistic societies.

  {"id":"khisaManagingEliteDefection2016","abstract":"Like other semi-authoritarian leaders, Uganda’s Yoweri Museveni faced constant threats of elite defections during successive general elections since 1996. Except in 2011 when he lured prominent opposition members to his ruling party, Museveni faced defections on the eve of four out of the five general elections during his rule: in 1996, 2001, 2006 and 2016. The 2015 defection of former Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi was billed as Museveni’s toughest challenge ever. However, Museveni successfully countered this threat with ministerial appointments, cash handouts along with targeted use of state coercive apparatus, chiefly the police, thus stopping Mbabazi from taking many National Resistance Movement (NRM) party elites into his camp to mount a serious electoral challenge. This article situates Mbabazi’s defection, and his poor performance at the polls going by the official election results, in the context of previous episodes of elite defections. The article argues that defections have been avoided and mitigated by a triple-strategy of elite inclusion, deterrence and the maintenance of various networks that constrain potential defectors. By documenting this theory with examples from previous and the 2016 elections, the article concludes that Mbabazi’s poor showing in the February 2016 election was predictable, in spite of his clout as heretofore the second most powerful figure in NRM and Museveni’s heir apparent.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Khisa","given":"Moses"}],"container-title":"Journal of Eastern African Studies","DOI":"10.1080/17531055.2016.1272288","ISSN":"1753-1055","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,1]]},"page":"729-748","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Managing elite defection in Museveni’s Uganda: the 2016 elections in perspective","title-short":"Managing elite defection in Museveni’s Uganda","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/17531055.2016.1272288","volume":"10"},

We formulate as a model of bilateral deterrence a game of incomplete information in which each player is uncertain about its opponent's preferences should it unilaterally alter the status quo. Uncertainty about the preferences of one's opponent leads to uncertainty about the opponent's willingness to retaliate. By identifying the credibility of each player's retaliatory threat with the probability that a player prefers retaliation to capitulation, we maintain consistency with both the traditional strategic literature, where credibility usually means believability, and with game theory, where credibility is usually synonymous with sequential rationality (i.e., subgame perfect equilibrium). We analyze formally the strategic implications of this conception of credibility and thus explore the critical role played by uncertainty in deterrence. By explicitly modeling uncertainty, we are able to understand the role of threats in contributing to, or detracting from, the robustness of a deterrence relationship.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,16]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Kilgour","given":"D.

  {"id":"killmisterDignityNotSuch2010","abstract":"In her 2003 article in the British Medical Journal, Ruth Macklin provocatively declared dignity to be a useless concept: either a vague restatement of other more precise values, such as autonomy or respect for persons, or an empty slogan. A recent response to Macklin has challenged this claim. Doris Schroeder attempts to rescue dignity by positing four distinct concepts that fall under the one umbrella term. She argues that much of the confusion surrounding dignity is due to the lack of disambiguation among these four concepts, but that once we understand the different values in question dignity becomes a powerful tool in the ﬁelds of human rights and bioethics. It is the goal of this paper to build upon Schroeder’s insights by reconnecting the multiple strands of dignity she identiﬁes. It will be argued that the usefulness of dignity as a guiding principle in medical ethics can be much improved by identifying the single conceptual link that ties together the various values ﬂying under its banner. That conceptual link is provided by understanding dignity as the capacity to live by one’s standards and principles.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Killmister","given":"S."}],"container-title":"Journal of Medical Ethics","DOI":"10.1136/jme.2009.031393","ISSN":"0306-6800","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"160-164","source":"Crossref","title":"Dignity: not such a useless concept","title-short":"Dignity","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://jme.bmj.com/cgi/doi/10.1136/jme.2009.031393","volume":"36"},

  {"id":"kimStealthMediaGroups2018","abstract":"In light of the foreign interference in the 2016 U.S. elections, the present research asks the question of whether the digital media has become the stealth media for anonymous political campaigns. By utilizing a user-based, real-time, digital ad tracking tool, the present research reverse engineers and tracks the groups (Study 1) and the targets (Study 2) of divisive issue campaigns based on 5 million paid ads on Facebook exposed to 9,519 individuals between September 28, 2016, and November 8, 2016. The findings reveal groups that did not file reports to the Federal Election Commission (FEC)—nonprofits, astroturf/movement groups, and unidentifiable “suspicious” groups, including foreign entities—ran most of the divisive issue campaigns. One out of six suspicious groups later turned out to be Russian groups. The volume of ads sponsored by non-FEC groups was 4 times larger than that of FEC groups. Divisive issue campaigns clearly targeted battleground states, including Pennsylvania and Wisconsin where traditional Democratic strongholds supported Donald Trump by a razor-thin margin. The present research asserts that media ecology, the technological features and capacity of digital media, as well as regulatory loopholes created by Citizens United v. FEC and the FEC’s disclaimer exemption for digital platforms contribute to the prevalence of anonymous groups’ divisive issue campaigns on digital media. The present research offers insight relevant for regulatory policy discussion and discusses the normative implications of the findings for the functioning of democracy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Kim","given":"Young Mie"},{"family":"Hsu","given":"Jordan"},{"family":"Neiman","given":"David"},{"family":"Kou","given":"Colin"},{"family":"Bankston","given":"Levi"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Soo Yun"},{"family":"Heinrich","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Baragwanath","given":"Robyn"},{"family":"Raskutti","given":"Garvesh"}],"container-title":"Political Communication","DOI":"10.1080/10584609.2018.1476425","ISSN":"1058-4609, 1091-7675","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,10,2]]},"language":"en","page":"515-541","source":"Crossref","title":"The Stealth Media?

  {"id":"kingModesExecutiveLegislativeRelations1976","abstract":"Political scientists and politicians both talk in terms of \"the relations between the executive and the legislature.\" But in fact it is seldom helpful to speak of \"executive-legislative relations\" tout court. If we wish to understand the phenomena generally subsumed under this heading, we need to identify and consider separately a number of quite distinct political relationships. Different patterns of such relationships are found in different countries. For example, in Great Britain the most important such relationship, or mode, is that which links the Government with backbench majority-party Members of Parliament. The same relationship is the most important in France. But in West Germany the relations both within and among parties are important, and so is a cross-party mode, operating within Bundestag committees, which has no real equivalent in either of the other countries.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,10]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"King","given":"Anthony"}],"container-title":"Legislative Studies Quarterly","DOI":"10.2307/439626","ISSN":"0362-9805","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1976]]},"page":"11-36","source":"JSTOR","title":"Modes of Executive-Legislative Relations: Great Britain, France, and West Germany","title-short":"Modes of Executive-Legislative Relations","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/439626","volume":"1"},
  {"id":"kingRacialOrdersAmerican2005","abstract":"American political science has long struggled to deal adequately with issues of race. Many studies inaccurately treat their topics as unrelated to race. Many studies of racial issues lack clear theoretical accounts of the relationships of race and politics. Drawing on arguments in the American political development literature, this essay argues for analyzing race, and American politics more broadly, in terms of two evolving, competing “racial institutional orders”: a “white supremacist” order and an “egalitarian transformative” order. This conceptual framework can synthesize and unify many arguments about race and politics that political scientists have advanced, and it can also serve to highlight the role of race in political developments that leading scholars have analyzed without attention to race. The argument here suggests that no analysis of American politics is likely to be adequate unless the impact of these racial orders is explicitly considered or their disregard explained.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,18]]},"author":[{"family":"King","given":"Desmond S."},{"family":"Smith","given":"Rogers M."}],"container-title":"American Political Science Review","DOI":"10.1017/S0003055405051506","ISSN":"1537-5943, 0003-0554","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,2]]},"language":"en","page":"75-92","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Racial Orders in American Political Development","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/racial-orders-in-american-political-development/78C4115EFEB5159EAE76D558D7D86CCB","volume":"99"},

Those who govern us work for us, and therefore they must also answer to us. But how do we reconcile calls for greater accountability with the competing need for secrecy, especially in matters of national security? Those two imperatives are usually taken to be antithetical, but Heidi Kitrosser argues convincingly that this is not the case--and that our concern ought to lie not with secrecy, but with the sort of unchecked secrecy that can result from \"presidentialism, \" or constitutional arguments for broad executive control of information. In Reclaiming Accountability, Kitrosser traces presidentialism from its start as part of a decades-old legal movement through its appearance during the Bush and Obama administrations, demonstrating its effects on secrecy throughout and explaining how presidentialist arguments misread the Constitution in a way that is profoundly at odds with democratic principles. ---","author":[{"family":"Kitrosser","given":"Heidi"}],"ISBN":"978-0-226-56567-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","note":"OCLC: 1031343640","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Reclaiming accountability: transparency, executive power, and the U.S. Constitution","title-short":"Reclaiming accountability","type":"book"},

Each group of voters is associated with distinctive “first dimension” views of economic redistribution and “second dimension” preferences concerning salient sociopolitical issues of civic and cultural liberties, race, and immigration. Macro-level hypotheses are developed about the changing voting behavior of education-income voting groups along with micro-level hypotheses about the propensity of vote switching. The hypotheses are tested with data from the American National Election Studies 1952–2016. A profound realignment is revealed between (groups of) white voters and the two main US parties that is consistent with the theoretical expectations developed in the article.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Kitschelt","given":"Herbert P."},{"family":"Rehm","given":"Philipp"}],"container-title":"Politics & Society","container-title-short":"Politics & Society","DOI":"10.1177/0032329219861215","ISSN":"0032-3292","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"425-479","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Secular Partisan Realignment in the United States: The Socioeconomic Reconfiguration of White Partisan Support since the New Deal Era","title-short":"Secular Partisan Realignment in the United States","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0032329219861215","volume":"47"},

Multiple regression analyses showed that procedural factors (decision control and respect) and distributive factors (feeling of winning what one wanted) were equally influential for parents' satisfaction as a group. However, the relative importance of procedural fairness and outcome favorability differed depending on disputant gender, favorability of outcomes, and level of conflict in the relationship. Support was found for Tyler's (1989) assertion that the specific procedural factor of decision control is especially important in dispute resolution settings. However, contrary to expectation, decision control was relatively more important to satisfaction in mediation than in litigation. It is suggested that the type of allocation setting may not be as influential for satisfaction as participants' status in the proceedings and their perceptions of the level of conflict.","author":[{"family":"Kitzmann","given":"Katherine M."},{"family":"Emery","given":"Robert E."}],"container-title":"Law and Human Behavior","container-title-short":"Law and Human Behavior","DOI":"10.1007/BF01045073","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[1993]]},"page":"553-567","title":"Procedural justice and parents' satisfaction in a field study of child custody dispute resolution","title-short":"Procedural justice and parents' satisfaction in a field study of child custody dispute resolution","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1007/BF01045073","volume":"17"},

This pessimism stems from Locke's recognition that the people are far too constitutionally passive for the vigilance essential to \"umpire\" well the necessity of executive action outside the laws. In fact, liberalism itself can contribute to such passivity: the people are content to allow an executive to act with a significant degree of discretion outside the laws so long as those actions do not interfere with their short-term interest in security and prosperity. Understanding Locke's pessimism regarding popular vigilance casts into new light his argument for a legislative constitutionalism based on fundamental laws that establish a clear separation of powers. Such fundamental laws provide legislative elites with the constitutional \"signals\" by which they can alert the otherwise slumbering people about an executive intent on usurpation and tyranny.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,10]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Kleinerman","given":"Benjamin A."}],"container-title":"The American Political Science Review","ISSN":"0003-0554","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"page":"209-222","source":"JSTOR","title":"Can the Prince Really Be Tamed?

  {"id":"knopsPlatformPoliticsEurope2019","abstract":"Increasingly, representation is seen as an interplay of representative claims. In this article, we study the representative claims formulated by Belgium’s Citizen’s Platform for Refugee Support (CPRS) and examine how the CPRS justifies its right to speak on behalf of others. Our qualitative analysis centers on the content of the CPRS Facebook page and how its features and affordances shape the CPRS’s representative strategies. Our findings reveal that the CPRS’s claims produce an alternative conception of “we, the people.” To create this other generality, the CPRS taps into the registers of proximity, impartiality, and reflexivity proposed by Rosanvallon as alternative legitimation mechanisms. We find that the CPRS predominantly draws on its proximity to the people it represents to legitimize its authority and that this, in turn, lays the foundation for its claims of impartiality. Facebook here plays an ambivalent role as both facilitator and detractor.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Knops","given":"Louise"},{"family":"Severs","given":"Eline"}],"container-title":"International Journal of Communication","ISSN":"1932-8036","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,30]]},"language":"en","number":"0","page":"19","source":"ijoc.org","title":"Platform Politics in Europe | Self-Appointed Representatives on Facebook: The Case of the Belgian Citizen’s Platform for Refugee Support","title-short":"Platform Politics in Europe | Self-Appointed Representatives on Facebook","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/10806","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"knudsenURBANDENSITYCREATIVITY","abstract":"Abstract: Geographers and social scientists have probed the effects of agglomeration and spatial clustering on innovation and economic growth. Economists and others have identified the role of knowledge spillovers in driving the innovation process. While innovation is thus assumed to be a function of proximity, there has been little systematic research on the role of density in innovation. Thus, this research investigates density, and more specifically the density of creative workers, as a key factor influencing regional innovation. It uses principal components analysis to create and implement a composite measure of density and presents a model of innovation as a function of creative-density. Statistical analyses including multivariate regression finds that density and creativity separately and jointly affect innovation in metropolitan areas. The regression analysis finds a positive relationship between the density of creative workers and metropolitan patenting activity. This suggests that density is a key component of knowledge spillovers and a key component of innovation.","author":[{"family":"Knudsen","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Florida","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Gates","given":"Gary"},{"family":"Stolarick","given":"Kevin"}],"language":"en","page":"40","source":"Zotero","title":"URBAN DENSITY, CREATIVITY, AND INNOVATION","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"kobayashiDepolarizationSocialMedia2020","abstract":"Despite the concern that partisan selectivity in the political use of social media leads to mass polarization, the empirical evidence is mixed at best. Given the possibility that these inconclusive findings are attributable to moderators in the process that have not been adequately studied, this article elaborates the roles played by different forms of social identities. By analyzing three datasets collected in Hong Kong, where Chinese and Hong Kongese identities are constructed in a nonmutually exclusive way, this study demonstrates that (1) partisan selectivity in media use is reliably detected among those with single Hong Kongese identity, but not among those with dual identities of Hong Kongese and Chinese, (2) the political use of social media polarizes the attitudes and affects of single identifiers, whereas it has depolarizing effects on dual identifiers, and (3) these contrasting effects on polarization between single and dual identifiers have downstream consequences for political participation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Kobayashi","given":"Tetsuro"}],"container-title":"New Media & Society","container-title-short":"New Media & Society","DOI":"10.1177/1461444820910124","ISSN":"1461-4448, 1461-7315","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,4]]},"language":"en","page":"146144482091012","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Depolarization through social media use: Evidence from dual identifiers in Hong Kong","title-short":"Depolarization through social media use","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1461444820910124"},
  {"id":"koc-michalskaOnlinePoliticalPosting2019","abstract":"The gender dynamics of political discussion are important. These dynamics shape who shares their political views and how they share their views and reactions to these views. Using representative survey data from the United States and the UK, we investigate how social media platforms shape the gender dynamics of political posting. We find that on Facebook, gender does not predict political posting, whereas on Twitter, the gender gap is more pronounced. We also examine the concept of “mansplaining”—a term used to describe a patronizing form of communication directed at women by men. Firstly, we find that posting about political issues to Twitter is more likely to result in being an explainee but also being an explainer of political issues. Furthermore, posting to Twitter increases the likelihood of men reporting having been accused of mansplaining and women reporting having experienced it. In general, more than half of the women say they have experienced mansplaining, especially those who are younger, well educated, and left-leaning. We argue that the possibility of being mansplained affects who is willing to post their opinions online, and as such, caution should be exercised when using digital trace data to represent public opinion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Koc-Michalska","given":"Karolina"},{"family":"Schiffrin","given":"Anya"},{"family":"Lopez","given":"Anamaria"},{"family":"Boulianne","given":"Shelley"},{"family":"Bimber","given":"Bruce"}],"container-title":"Social Science Computer Review","container-title-short":"Social Science Computer Review","DOI":"10.1177/0894439319870259","ISSN":"0894-4393","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,3]]},"language":"en","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"From Online Political Posting to Mansplaining: The Gender Gap and Social Media in Political Discussion","title-short":"From Online Political Posting to Mansplaining","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0894439319870259"},

It argues that the increasing criminalization of welfare fraud was instrumental in undermining political support for key social welfare programs, particularly Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). In the 1970s, lawmakers and welfare administrators enlisted law enforcement’s expanding authority to contain growing welfare costs and counter demands from the welfare rights movement. It was from these anti-welfare fraud campaigns that the racialized caricature of the “welfare queen” entered the political lexicon. Recruiting the criminal justice system further stigmatized AFDC recipients by positioning them as criminally suspect, financially secure, and morally unworthy. I argue that while increased penalties for welfare fraud did not swell the penal system to the same extent as initiatives like the War on Drugs, they shaped popular knowledge about poor families and undermined faith in the state’s capacity to mitigate inequality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Kohler-Hausmann","given":"Julilly"}],"container-title":"Journal of Urban History","DOI":"10.1177/0096144215589942","ISSN":"0096-1442, 1552-6771","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,9]]},"language":"en","page":"756-771","source":"Crossref","title":"Welfare Crises, Penal Solutions, and the Origins of the “Welfare Queen”","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0096144215589942","volume":"41"},

It analyzes the contradiction between Douglass's defense of pacifism in his speeches and articles (before 1847) and his celebration of the redemptive effects of violence in his autobiographies, most notably in his account of his fight with the slave breaker Edward Covey. One thing that distinguishes this article from other interpretations of Douglass is that it draws upon another famous account of the struggle between master and slave—Hegel's dialectic of lordship and bondage—in order to offer a novel resolution to this interpretive puzzle.

This article will analyze the decision-making processes of one of the largest online communities, Wikipedia. Founded in 2001, Wikipedia—now among the top-10 most popular sites on the Internet—has succeeded in attracting and organizing millions of volunteers and creating the world's largest encyclopedia. To date, however, little study has been done of Wikipedia's governance. There is substantial confusion about its decision-making structure. The organization's governance has been compared to many decision-making and political systems—from democracy to dictatorship, from bureaucracy to anarchy. It is the purpose of this article to go beyond the earlier simplistic descriptions of Wikipedia's governance in order to advance the study of online governance, and of organizations more generally. As the evidence will show, while Wikipedia's governance shows elements common to many traditional governance models, it appears to be closest to the organizational structure known as adhocracy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Konieczny","given":"Piotr"}],"container-title":"Journal of Information Technology & Politics","DOI":"10.1080/19331681.2010.489408","ISSN":"1933-1681","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,10,11]]},"page":"263-283","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Adhocratic Governance in the Internet Age: A Case of Wikipedia","title-short":"Adhocratic Governance in the Internet Age","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/19331681.2010.489408","volume":"7"},

Understanding how and why rumors spread in these contexts could assist in the design of systems that facilitate timely and accurate sensemaking. We address a basic question in this line: To what extent does rumor evolution occur (1) through reliance on a centralized information source, (2) in parallel information silos, or (3) through a web of complex informational interactions? We develop a conceptual model and associated analysis algorithms that allow us to distinguish between these possibilities. We analyze a case of rumoring on Twitter during the Boston Marathon Bombing. We ﬁnd that rumor spreading was predominantly a parallel process in this case, which is consistent with a hypothesis that information silos may underlie the persistence of false rumors. Special attention towards detecting and resolving parallel information threads during collective sensemaking may hence be warranted.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Krafft","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Kaitlyn"},{"family":"Edwards","given":"Isabelle"},{"family":"Starbird","given":"Kate"},{"family":"Spiro","given":"Emma S."}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the 2017 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","DOI":"10.1145/3025453.3026012","event":"CHI '17: CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","event-place":"Denver Colorado USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-4655-9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,2]]},"language":"en","page":"2976-2987","publisher":"ACM","publisher-place":"Denver Colorado USA","source":"Crossref","title":"Centralized, Parallel, and Distributed Information Processing during Collective Sensemaking","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3025453.3026012"},

First, the article develops Chambliss’s argument that criminologists should deﬁne state crime as behavior that violates international agreements and principles established in the courts and treaties of international bodies. Second, although Chambliss effectively argued that international law ‘‘on the books’’ provides a framework of substantive concepts and categories that allows criminologists to deﬁne certain state actions as a form of crime, ‘‘in action’’ international laws fail to provide legal accountability for states and protection for victims.

  {"id":"kreissArbitersWhatOur2019","abstract":"The question of how Facebook and Google make and justify decisions regarding permissible political advertising on their platforms is increasingly important. In this paper, we focus on the U.S. case and present findings from interviews with 17 former social media firm employees (n = 7) and political practitioners (n = 11). We also analyze emails (n = 45) exchanged between Facebook government and elections staffers and two campaigns, a U.S. gubernatorial (2017) and presidential campaign (2016), regarding the platform’s policies in the context of paid speech. In addressing questions about Facebook’s and Google’s processes and policies regarding paid political content, the rationales for them, and the ability of campaigns to contest decisions, this study shows how while Facebook and Google resist being arbiters of political discourse, they actively vet paid content on their platforms. These platforms differ with respect to how and what decisions they make in the context of paid speech and within each company there are active and ongoing debates among staffers about speech. These debates at times take place in consultation with political practitioners and often occur in the context of external events. Across these firms, policies regarding speech evolve through these internal debates, appeals by practitioners, and outside pressure. At the same time, both Facebook and Google make decisions in often opaque ways, according to policies that are not transparent, and without clear justifications to campaigns or the public as to how they are applied or enforced. This limits options for political practitioners to contest regulation decisions. Finally, we conclude by arguing for the need for expanded capacities for political practitioners and the public to exercise voice around the content decisions that these firms make, and for firms to create more robust institutional mechanisms for incorporating it.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Kreiss","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Mcgregor","given":"Shannon C."}],"container-title":"Political Communication","DOI":"10.1080/10584609.2019.1619639","ISSN":"1058-4609, 1091-7675","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,2]]},"language":"en","page":"499-522","source":"Crossref","title":"The “Arbiters of What Our Voters See”: Facebook and Google’s Struggle with Policy, Process, and Enforcement around Political Advertising","title-short":"The “Arbiters of What Our Voters See”","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10584609.2019.1619639","volume":"36"},
  {"id":"kreissTechnologyFirmsShape2018","abstract":"This article offers the first analysis of the role that technology companies, specifically Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, and Google, play in shaping the political communication of electoral campaigns in the United States. We offer an empirical analysis of the work technology firms do around electoral politics through interviews with staffers at these firms and digital and social media directors of 2016 U.S. presidential primary and general election campaigns, in addition to field observations at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. We find that technology firms are motivated to work in the political space for marketing, advertising revenue, and relationship-building in the service of lobbying efforts. To facilitate this, these firms have developed organizational structures and staffing patterns that accord with the partisan nature of American politics. Furthermore, Facebook, Twitter, and Google go beyond promoting their services and facilitating digital advertising buys, actively shaping campaign communication through their close collaboration with political staffers. We show how representatives at these firms serve as quasi-digital consultants to campaigns, shaping digital strategy, content, and execution. Given this, we argue that political communication scholars need to consider social media firms as more active agents in political processes than previously appreciated in the literature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Kreiss","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Mcgregor","given":"Shannon C."}],"container-title":"Political Communication","DOI":"10.1080/10584609.2017.1364814","ISSN":"1058-4609, 1091-7675","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,4,3]]},"language":"en","page":"155-177","source":"Crossref","title":"Technology Firms Shape Political Communication: The Work of Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, and Google With Campaigns During the 2016 U.S. Presidential Cycle","title-short":"Technology Firms Shape Political Communication","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10584609.2017.1364814","volume":"35"},

  {"id":"krollAccountableAlgorithms2016","abstract":"Many important decisions historically made by people are now made by computers. Algorithms count votes, approve loan and credit card applications, target citizens or neighborhoods for police scrutiny, select taxpayers for an IRS audit, and grant or deny immigration visas.The accountability mechanisms and legal standards that govern such decision processes have not kept pace with technology. The tools currently available to policymakers, legislators, and courts were developed to oversee human decision-makers and often fail when applied to computers instead: for example, how do you judge the intent of a piece of software? Additional approaches are needed to make automated decision systems — with their potentially incorrect, unjustified or unfair results — accountable and governable. This Article reveals a new technological toolkit to verify that automated decisions comply with key standards of legal fairness.We challenge the dominant position in the legal literature that transparency will solve these problems. Disclosure of source code is often neither necessary (because of alternative techniques from computer science) nor sufficient (because of the complexity of code) to demonstrate the fairness of a process. Furthermore, transparency may be undesirable, such as when it permits tax cheats or terrorists to game the systems determining audits or security screening.The central issue is how to assure the interests of citizens, and society as a whole, in making these processes more accountable. This Article argues that technology is creating new opportunities — more subtle and flexible than total transparency — to design decision-making algorithms so that they better align with legal and policy objectives. Doing so will improve not only the current governance of algorithms, but also — in certain cases — the governance of decision-making in general. The implicit (or explicit) biases of human decision-makers can be difficult to find and root out, but we can peer into the “brain” of an algorithm: computational processes and purpose specifications can be declared prior to use and verified afterwards.The technological tools introduced in this Article apply widely. They can be used in designing decision-making processes from both the private and public sectors, and they can be tailored to verify different characteristics as desired by decision-makers, regulators, or the public. By forcing a more careful consideration of the effects of decision rules, they also engender policy discussions and closer looks at legal standards. As such, these tools have far-reaching implications throughout law and society.Part I of this Article provides an accessible and concise introduction to foundational computer science concepts that can be used to verify and demonstrate compliance with key standards of legal fairness for automated decisions without revealing key attributes of the decision or the process by which the decision was reached. Part II then describes how these techniques can assure that decisions are made with the key governance attribute of procedural regularity, meaning that decisions are made under an announced set of rules consistently applied in each case. We demonstrate how this approach could be used to redesign and resolve issues with the State Department’s diversity visa lottery. In Part III, we go further and explore how other computational techniques can assure that automated decisions preserve fidelity to substantive legal and policy choices. We show how these tools may be used to assure that certain kinds of unjust discrimination are avoided and that automated decision processes behave in ways that comport with the social or legal standards that govern the decision. We also show how algorithmic decision-making may even complicate existing doctrines of disparate treatment and disparate impact, and we discuss some recent computer science work on detecting and removing discrimination in algorithms, especially in the context of big data and machine learning. And lastly in Part IV, we propose an agenda to f rther synergistic collaboration between computer science, law and policy to advance the design of automated decision processes for accountability.","author":[{"family":"Kroll","given":"Joshua A."},{"family":"Huey","given":"Joanna"},{"family":"Barocas","given":"Solon"},{"family":"Felten","given":"Edward W."},{"family":"Reidenberg","given":"Joel R."},{"family":"Robinson","given":"David G."},{"family":"Yu","given":"Harlan"}],"event-place":"Rochester, NY","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"publisher":"Social Science Research Network","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","title":"Accountable Algorithms","title-short":"Accountable Algorithms","type":"report","URL":"http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2765268"},

We use data from in-depth interviews with Millennials and Generation Xers to refute this claim. Speciﬁcally, our results suggest that respondents do not engage in communicative action typical of the public sphere because they avoid political discourse online. Three factors inﬂuence this: (1) fear of online harassment and workplace surveillance; (2) engagement only with politically similar others; and (3) characterization of social media as a place for “happy” interactions. In addition, we ﬁnd that these three factors interrelate, often sequentially, and we explore similarities and minor diﬀerences between Millennials and Generation Xers regarding each factor.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Kruse","given":"Lisa M."},{"family":"Norris","given":"Dawn R."},{"family":"Flinchum","given":"Jonathan R."}],"container-title":"The Sociological Quarterly","DOI":"10.1080/00380253.2017.1383143","ISSN":"0038-0253, 1533-8525","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,2]]},"language":"en","page":"62-84","source":"Crossref","title":"Social Media as a Public Sphere?

Dichotomies that allegedly necessitate choice, perhaps tragic, proliferate: individual (or civil society) versus the state, liberty versus equality, liberalism versus communitarianism, universal versus local, are just a few examples. It is left to a few old fogies to mumble that these dichotomies might just be aspects of complex phenomena which can manage to include them both. Few find such reminders convincing, still even fewer interesting. Nevertheless, I’m with the fogies.

  {"id":"krygierRuleLawAbuser2007","abstract":"I have been invited to write about abuse of the rule of law. This is not an altogether comfortable assignment, since I have long believed that the rule of law is a very good thing. Without it, at least in conditions of modernity, life is immeasurably worse than where it is secure. But then families are good things too, yet we know bad things can happen in families. So perhaps the rule of law also has dark sides. This chapter explores that possibility. It begins by sketching an approach to the rule of law that I have elaborated elsewhere and that differs from some. In particular, it does not offer, as lawyers typically do, a general deﬁnition that picks out characteristics of laws and legal institutions supposedly necessary, if not sufﬁcient, for the rule of law to exist. Rather, it begins with teleology and ends with sociology. I then enumerate and discuss several ways in which the rule of law might be associated with abuse. I speak of verbal abuse, harms to and through the rule of law, and misuse. Though abuses are not hard to ﬁnd, I do not think that every apparent abuse of the rule of law is rightly so called. In the course of discussion, I have something to say about what the rule of law requires in order to be used well, as well as what constitutes abuse of it. I also seek to dispel some misconceptions about what it is, what it depends upon, and what violates it. In other terms, and in terms of my invitation, not all abuse of the rule of law shows its dark side. Other things are going on. But there are dark sides also, and I will discuss some of them.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,10,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Krygier","given":"Martin Evald John"}],"container-title":"SSRN Electronic Journal","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.952576","ISSN":"1556-5068","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"language":"en","source":"Crossref","title":"The Rule of Law: An Abuser's Guide","title-short":"The Rule of Law","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ssrn.com/abstract=952576"},

The article seeks to support the rule of law ideal, if not all the ways it is invoked, by recovering some past thinking about and experience with and without the rule of law understood this way. The review criticizes current discussions for their temporal parochialism and their inadequate treatment of ideals and of contexts.

  {"id":"kumarAlgorithmicDanceYouTube2019","abstract":"The March 2017 advertiser revolt on YouTube, popularly known as the adpocalypse, introduced widespread and radical changes on the platform’s policies related to the moderation of content, their ‘monetisability’ and the terms of the relationship between creators and the platform. These changes in turn have caused significant discontent within the creator community while also gradually transforming the predominant nature of content on the platform. This essay analyses this controversy that is yet to be subjected to a scholarly investigation, in order to probe the ways in which algorithmic moderation of content affects their monetisability and consequently the viewership patterns of culture. Through closely studying the new regime of content moderation and analysing user testimonies in the aftermath of the ‘Adpocalypse’, this essay poses critical questions about the public utility like role of digital platforms whose gatekeeping function remains largely outside the purview of public debate and deliberation.","author":[{"family":"Kumar","given":"Sangeet"}],"issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"21","source":"Zotero","title":"The algorithmic dance: YouTube’s Adpocalypse and the gatekeeping of cultural content on digital platforms","type":"article-journal","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"kymlickaSolidarityDiverseSocieties2015","abstract":"In the postwar period, projects of social justice have often drawn upon ideas of national solidarity, calling upon shared national identities to mobilize support for the welfare state. Several commentators have argued that increasing immigration, and the multiculturalism policies it often gives rise to, weaken this sense of national solidarity. This creates a potential “progressive’s dilemma”, forcing a choice between solidarity and diversity. My aim in this paper is two-fold: first, to argue for the importance of national solidarity as a progressive political resource; and second, to discuss how it can be reconciled with support for immigration and multiculturalism. I will try to identify the prospects for a multicultural national solidarity – a multicultural welfare state, if you will – and to contrast it with the two obvious alternatives: a neoliberal multiculturalism that champions mobility and diversity at the expense of national solidarity; and a welfare chauvinism that champions national solidarity at the expense of immigrants and minorities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Kymlicka","given":"Will"}],"container-title":"Comparative Migration Studies","container-title-short":"Comparative Migration Studies","DOI":"10.1186/s40878-015-0017-4","ISSN":"2214-594X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,12,17]]},"page":"17","source":"BioMed Central","title":"Solidarity in diverse societies: beyond neoliberal multiculturalism and welfare chauvinism","title-short":"Solidarity in diverse societies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40878-015-0017-4","volume":"3"},
  {"id":"labordeConstitutionalCivicPatriotism2002","abstract":"Constitutional patriotism is an influential attempt to reconcile the conflicting imperatives of political legitimacy and cultural inclusiveness. However, it underestimates the role of particularist political cultures in grounding universalistic principles of democracy and justice. Civic patriotism, by contrast, emphasizes the motivational prerequisites of democratic governance, stresses the need to preserve existing 'co-operative ventures' such as nation-states, and demands that existing political cultures be democratically scrutinized and re-shaped in an inclusive direction. It promotes a mainly political identity, whose political content makes it compatible with a variety of practices and beliefs, but whose thin particularistic form justifies citizens' commitment to specific institutions. This commitment is not so unconditional as to justify blind loyalty to one's own institutions, nor is it so absolute as to rule out certain forms of cosmopolitan citizenship.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Laborde","given":"Cécile"}],"container-title":"British Journal of Political Science","ISSN":"0007-1234","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002]]},"page":"591-612","source":"JSTOR","title":"From Constitutional to Civic Patriotism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/4092375","volume":"32"},
  {"id":"labordeFemaleAutonomyEducation2006","abstract":"This essay discusses one of the motives behind the recent ban on the wearing of Muslim headscarves (hijab1) in French schools: the belief that it assists the emancipation of Muslim girls from religious and patriarchal oppression.2 The first section sets out a republican perfectionist case for the ban, based on Enlightenment assumptions about progressive secular rationalism, education to autonomy, and criticism of the pre-modern, patriarchal nature of Islam. The second section mounts a critical response, which rejects republican paternalism and connects insights from the post-modern sociology of religion with radical feminist theories of female agency. In the third section, I show that both arguments, even on the most sympathetic interpretation I present here, are flawed. I argue that although the ban on the hijab cannot be justified, republicans are right to worry about the dangers of domination in civil society. I then set out a ‘critical republican’ theory of non-domination which avoids the pitfalls of coercive paternalism without, however, leaving individuals unaided in the face of domination.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Laborde","given":"Cécile"}],"container-title":"Critical Review of International Social and Political Philosophy","container-title-short":"Critical Review of International Social and Political Philosophy","DOI":"10.1080/13698230600900909","ISSN":"1369-8230, 1743-8772","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,9]]},"language":"en","page":"351-377","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Female Autonomy, Education and the <i>Hijab</i>","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13698230600900909","volume":"9"},

But how many of the relevant developments are indeed associated with populism? And is any such association a contingent or analytic matter: Does populism inevitably threaten the rule of law, or do other conditions intervene to shape its impact? After setting out how I understand the rule of law and populism, I examine the ways in which contemporary populist discourse has challenged the rule of law through a variety of mechanisms—notably agenda setting, policy impact, influence on discretionary decisions, and convention trashing—considering the institutional and social conditions that conduce to strengthen or weaken these mechanisms in particular contexts. Finally, I consider the implications of the analysis for contemporary criminalization, assessing how many of the factors producing penal populism or overcriminalization are truly a product of populism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Lacey","given":"Nicola"}],"container-title":"Annual Review of Law and Social Science","DOI":"10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-101518-042919","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"page":"79-96","source":"Annual Reviews","title":"Populism and the Rule of Law","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-101518-042919","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"lacroixEuropeanConstitutionalPatriotism2002","abstract":"In recent years, two dominant models for understanding the source of common political identities have emerged in the European context: the universalist paradigm of constitutional patriotism and the communitarian paradigm of ‘civic nationalism’. In view of this dichotomy, one could be tempted to think that only a combination of these two positions could deal with the mixed nature of European architecture. The European Union would thus give birth to the appealing synthesis of a ‘cosmopolitan communitarianism’. This choice of a middle way is challenged in this paper. Instead, I argue that the national or communitarian challenge would be better met by the development of constitutional patriotism rather than by a loose compromise. Contrary to what most commentators seem to believe, constitutional patriotism has practical significance, is historically embedded and seeks to promote a shared political culture.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Lacroix","given":"Justine"}],"container-title":"Political Studies","DOI":"10.1111/1467-9248.00402","ISSN":"1467-9248","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002]]},"language":"en","page":"944-958","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"For a European Constitutional Patriotism","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1467-9248.00402","volume":"50"},

  {"id":"landemoreDefenseWorkplaceDemocracy2016","abstract":"In the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, an important conceptual battleground for democratic theorists ought to be, it would seem, the capitalist firm. We are now painfully aware that the typical model of government in so-called investor-owned companies remains profoundly oligarchic, hierarchical, and unequal. Renewing with the literature of the 1970s and 1980s on workplace democracy, a few political theorists have started to advocate democratic reforms of the workplace by relying on an analogy between firm and state. To the extent that a firm is an organization comparable to the state, it too ought to be ruled along democratic lines. Our paper tests the robustness of the analogy between firm and state by considering six major objections to it: (1) the objection from a difference in ends, (2) the objection from shareholders’ property rights, (3) the objection from worker’s consent, (4) the objection from workers’ exit opportunities, (5) the objection from workers’ (lack of) expertise, and (6) the objection from the fragility of firms. We find all of these objections wanting. While the paper does not ambition to settle the issue of workplace democracy at once, our goal is to pave the way for a more in-depth study of the ways in which firms and states can be compared and the possible implications this may have for our understanding of the nature of managerial authority and the governance of firms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Landemore","given":"Hélène"},{"family":"Ferreras","given":"Isabelle"}],"container-title":"Political Theory","container-title-short":"Political Theory","DOI":"10.1177/0090591715600035","ISSN":"0090-5917","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"53-81","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"In Defense of Workplace Democracy: Towards a Justification of the Firm–State Analogy","title-short":"In Defense of Workplace Democracy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0090591715600035","volume":"44"},

Implications are that the SET is a faulty measure of teaching quality and grades a faulty signal of future job performance. Students, faculty, and provost appear to be engaged in an individually rational but socially destructive game of grade inflation centered on the link between SETs and grades. When performance is hard to measure, pay-for-performance, embodied by the link between SETs and faculty pay, may have unintended adverse consequences.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Langbein","given":"Laura"}],"container-title":"Economics of Education Review","container-title-short":"Economics of Education Review","DOI":"10.1016/j.econedurev.2006.12.003","ISSN":"0272-7757","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,8,1]]},"page":"417-428","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Management by results: Student evaluation of faculty teaching and the mis-measurement of performance","title-short":"Management by results","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775707000477","volume":"27"},
  {"id":"langeCulturesHighfrequencyTrading2016","abstract":"As part of ongoing work to lay a foundation for social studies of high-frequency trading (HFT), this paper introduces the culture(s) of HFT as a sociological problem relating to knowledge and practice. HFT is often discussed as a purely technological development, where all that matters is the speed of allocating, processing and transmitting data. Indeed, the speed at which trades are executed and data transmitted is accelerating, and it is fair to say that algorithms are now the primary interacting agents operating in the financial markets. However, we contend that HFT is first and foremost a cultural phenomenon. More specifically, both individuals and collective agents – such as algorithms – might be considered cultural entities, charged with very different ways of processing information, making sense of it and turning it into knowledge and practice. This raises issues relating to situated knowledge, distributed cognition and action, the assignment of responsibility when regulating high-speed algorithms, their history, organizational structure and, perhaps more fundamentally, their representation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Lange","given":"Ann-Christina"},{"family":"Lenglet","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Seyfert","given":"Robert"}],"container-title":"Economy and Society","DOI":"10.1080/03085147.2016.1213986","ISSN":"0308-5147","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,4,2]]},"page":"149-165","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Cultures of high-frequency trading: mapping the landscape of algorithmic developments in contemporary financial markets","title-short":"Cultures of high-frequency trading","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/03085147.2016.1213986","volume":"45"},

As hundreds of thousands of Muscovites repeatedly flooded the streets in protest between December 2011 and May 2012 and smaller rallies took place in dozens of other cities, it became clear that Putin and his United Russia party were losing popularity— particularly among the more urban, affluent, and influential segments of the population. Even now, a year into Putin’s third term, the regime has failed to return to business as usual.

Hayek distinguishes two ways in which the judiciary provides such checks and balances: judicial independence and constitutional review. We create a new database of constitutional rules in 71 countries that reflect these provisions. We find strong support for the proposition that both judicial independence and constitutional review are associated with greater freedom. Consistent with theory, judicial independence accounts for some of the positive effect of common‐law legal origin on measures of economic freedom. The results point to significant benefits of the Anglo‐American system of government for freedom.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,10]]},"author":[{"family":"La Porta","given":"Rafael"},{"family":"López‐de‐Silanes","given":"Florencio"},{"family":"Pop‐Eleches","given":"Cristian"},{"family":"Shleifer","given":"Andrei"}],"container-title":"Journal of Political Economy","DOI":"10.1086/381480","ISSN":"0022-3808","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004]]},"page":"445-470","source":"JSTOR","title":"Judicial Checks and Balances","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/381480","volume":"112"},

The widespread practice of user agreements and consent-based regulation of personal data collection is not satisfactory for balancing these information-asymmetric markets. The lack of transparency deriving from the complex and massive datafication of consumers – where consumers are profiled, data is brokered and the algorithmically automated decision-making is opaque – speaks to the need for improved supervision at a more structural level above and beyond the individual consumer’s choices, preferably by more active consumer protection authorities.","author":[{"family":"Larsson","given":"Stefan"}],"issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","page":"13","source":"Zotero","title":"Algorithmic governance and the need for consumer empowerment in data-driven markets","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},

Focusing on the one-month period leading up to the 2018 Swedish national elections, the study finds that right-wing actors across the media and the political sector are more successful in engaging their Facebook followers than their competitors.

The essay focuses on dueling, one of the most important practices for the maintenance of aristocratic honor, at the moments of transition, primarily in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The author argues that the practice has resources for an egalitarian refashioning. This is because it is a system for the distribution of respect and because it involves social equals. At the same time, it is necessarily masculine, which limits the degree to which it can realize equality. The essay argues that the egalitarian refashioning emerged in part out of eighteenth-century thinkers' own reinterpretation of the practice.

Constitution-making routinely implicates multiple authors, constituencies, and narratives in a process that is part negotiation, part dialectic, and part coercion.  This multiplicity of participants and processes renders the distinction between “imposed” and “unimposed” constitutions highly arbitrary.  On the one hand, even an ostensibly imposed constitution can reflect a considerable measure of local input and influence.  On the other hand, elements of imposition and alienation are arguably endemic to all constitutions, regardless of how or where they are authored.

  {"id":"lawShamConstitutions2013","abstract":"It is often said that constitutions are mere parchment barriers that cannot by themselves limit the power of the state or guarantee respect for rights. Little is known at a global and empirical level, however, about the extent to which countries fall short of their constitutional guarantees. This Article documents empirically the global prevalence and severity of constitutional noncompliance over the last three decades and identifies the worst offenders, or \"sham constitutions,\" across several substantive categories. By matching our own data on the rights-related content of the world's constitutions with quantitative indicators of actual human rights performance, we calculate numerical scores that capture the extent to which countries violate the rights pledged in their constitutions or, conversely, uphold more rights than their constitutions contain. These scores are then used to rank countries according to their constitutional \"underperformance\" or \"overperformance.\" Each country's performance is further analyzed across three subcategories—namely, personal integrity rights, civil and political freedoms, and socioeconomic and group rights. The resulting performance scores reveal a number of global trends in constitutional compliance. On average, socioeconomic and group rights are somewhat less likely to be upheld than the other two varieties of rights, but the performance gap among the categories is narrowing over time. Moreover, a country's performance in one category tends to only weakly correlate with its performance in other categories. Relatively few countries fail egregiously to uphold either the positive or the negative rights found in their constitutions. Meanwhile, considerable variation exists in the degree to which specific rights are upheld in practice, ranging from 12% compliance with torture prohibitions to 100% compliance with death penalty prohibitions. Constitutional compliance also exhibits strong geographical patterns. Countries in Africa and Asia tend to promise a wide range of rights in their constitutions but vary greatly in the degree to which they satisfy those self-imposed obligations, with the result that the two continents are home to a substantial majority of the world's sham constitutions. These regional patterns persist, moreover, even if one controls for such variables as wealth and population size. Finally, statistical analysis identifies a number of variables that tend to predict the degree to which countries underperform on their constitutional guarantees. In past decades, the mere inclusion of socioeconomic rights in a constitution was associated with underperformance, but no longer. Wealthy and strongly democratic countries are relatively more likely to uphold constitutional rights, whereas countries that are afflicted by civil war or promise a large number of rights are more likely to fall short. However, neither the existence of judicial review nor the ratification of human rights treaties is statistically associated with increased respect for constitutional rights. Likewise, we find no evidence that constitutional clauses that expressly limit the reach of various rights affect the extent to which those rights are actually upheld.","author":[{"family":"Law","given":"David"},{"family":"Versteeg","given":"Mila"}],"container-title":"California Law Review","ISSN":"0008-1221","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"page":"863-952","title":"Sham Constitutions","title-short":"Sham Constitutions","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:riGmNN8nJiwJ:scholar.google.com/&hl=en&num=20&as_sdt=0,5","volume":"101"},

We examine the workers’ efforts to initiate a union in their workplace as a sociomaterial process of organizing. An analysis of unionization-related Facebook pages and interviews with union activists reveals how the activists leveraged the portable-visibility afforded by social media networks (Facebook and WhatsApp) and mobile devices (Smartphones) to create and express their collective voice, achieving both mobilization of workers and recognition by management. The analysis traces how the activists tactically leveraged the portable-visibility of the media they used, fine-tuning visibility and manipulating portability during the covert and overt phases of their campaign. In the conclusion, we unpack the challenges involved in utilizing these neoliberal platforms in workers unionization efforts within the organizational setting and discuss the implications of these tensions for the study of both organizational resistance and mass protest.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Lazar","given":"Tamar"},{"family":"Ribak","given":"Rivka"},{"family":"Davidson","given":"Roei"}],"container-title":"Information, Communication & Society","DOI":"10.1080/1369118X.2018.1510536","ISSN":"1369-118X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,23]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2018.1510536","page":"437-453","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Mobile social media as platforms in workers’ unionization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2018.1510536","volume":"23"},

  {"id":"lebronEqualityHumanPoint2014","abstract":"Racial inequality remains a persistent feature of American life. Despite the prominent place the idea of equality holds in the tradition of political philosophy, we remain without an effective conception appropriate for the experience of racial inequality. In this paper, I re-frame debates around equality and egalitarianism by reflecting on some of James Baldwin’s more strident arguments in his 1965 debate with William Buckley. I suggest he presses two complaints that are fundamental to racial inequality: the complaints of democratic distance and of disaffection. I then argue that while contemporary egalitarian theorists such as G. A. Cohen, Ronald Dworkin, Richard Arneson, and Elizabeth Anderson all claim to have isolated in their work a preferred conception of equality, they are unable to respond to Baldwin’s complaints, thus unable to effectively address the experience of racial inequality. I then leverage Bernard Williams’s distinction between a technological view of equality and a human view alongside his writing on imagination to offer a framework for meeting the moral demands that arise from taking the experience of racial inequality as fundamental to considerations over social and political equality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,10]]},"author":[{"literal":"Lebron"}],"container-title":"Critical Philosophy of Race","DOI":"10.5325/critphilrace.2.2.0125","ISSN":"21658684","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","page":"125-159","source":"Crossref","title":"Equality from a Human Point of View","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/critphilrace.2.2.0125","volume":"2"},
  {"id":"lebronMakingBlackLives2017","abstract":"\"Started in the wake of George Zimmerman's 2013 acquittal in the death of Trayvon Martin, the #BlackLivesMatter movement has become a powerful and uncompromising campaign demanding redress for the brutal and unjustified treatment of black bodies by law enforcement in the United States. The movement is only a few years old, but as Christopher J. Lebron argues in this book, the sentiment behind it is not; the plea and demand that \"Black Lives Matter\" comes out of a much older and richer tradition arguing for the equal dignity--and not just equal rights--of black people. The Making of Black Lives Matter presents a condensed and accessible intellectual history that traces the genesis of the ideas that have built into the #BlackLivesMatter movement. Drawing on the work of revolutionary black public intellectuals, including Frederick Douglass, Ida B. Wells, Langston Hughes, Zora Neal Hurston, Anna Julia Cooper, Audre Lorde, James Baldwin, and Martin Luther King, Jr., Lebron clarifies what it means to assert that \"Black Lives Matter\" when faced with contemporary instances of anti-black law enforcement. He also illuminates the crucial difference between the problem signaled by the social media hashtag and how we think that we ought to address the problem. As Lebron states, police body cameras, or even the exhortation for civil rights mean nothing in the absence of equality and dignity. To upset dominant practices of abuse, oppression and disregard, we must reach instead for radical sensibility. Radical sensibility requires that we become cognizant of the history of black thought and activism in order to make sense of the emotions, demands, and argument of present-day activists and public thinkers. Only in this way can we truly embrace and pursue the idea of racial progress in America.\"--Jacket.","archive":"/z-wcorg/","author":[{"family":"Lebron","given":"Christopher J.","suffix":""}],"event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-19-060134-8 0-19-060134-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"English","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"New York","source":"http://worldcat.org","title":"The making of Black lives matter : a brief history of an idea","type":"book"},

After conducting a detailed analysis of recommendations received by each channel type, we refute the popular radicalization claims. To the contrary, these data suggest that YouTubes recommendation algorithm actively discourages viewers from visiting radicalizing or extremist content. Instead, the algorithm is shown to favor mainstream media and cable news content over independent YouTube channels with slant towards left-leaning or politically neutral channels. Our study thus suggests that YouTubes recommendation algorithm fails to promote inﬂammatory or radicalized content, as previously claimed by several outlets.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Ledwich","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Zaitsev","given":"Anna"}],"container-title":"arXiv:1912.11211 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,24]]},"language":"en","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Algorithmic Extremism: Examining YouTube's Rabbit Hole of Radicalization","title-short":"Algorithmic Extremism","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11211"},

Economists, geographers, and other social scientists have examined the effects of innovation on economic growth, the factors associated with the production of innovations, and the geographic distribution of innovations. Jane Jacobs notes that the capacity to innovate is a product of a local environment or milieu that attracts talented people and is open and creative. Following Jacobs, this paper argues that innovation is a joint product of human capital and creativity. The capacity to innovate is seen to be a function of a region’s ability to attract human capital and to provide low barriers to entry for talented and creative people of all backgrounds. Multivariate models are used to test the joint effects of research and development expenditure, human capital, creativity/diversity, and industry mix on regional innovation. New measures of creativity (the bohemian index) and diversity (the gay index) are introduced. The findings suggest that innovation at the regional level is positively and significantly associated with both human capital and creativity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Sam Youl"},{"family":"Florida","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Gates","given":"Gary"}],"container-title":"International Review of Public Administration","DOI":"10.1080/12294659.2010.10805158","ISSN":"1229-4659","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,1,1]]},"page":"13-24","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Innovation, Human Capital, and Creativity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/12294659.2010.10805158","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"leeMobilizingPublicOpinion2002","abstract":"What motivates us to change our opinions during times of political protest and social unrest? To investigate this question, Taeku Lee's smartly argued book looks to the critical struggle over the moral principles, group interests, and racial animosities that defined public support for racial policies during the civil rights movement, from the late 1940s to the mid-1960s. Challenging the conventional view that public opinion is shaped by elites, Lee crafts an alternate account of the geographic, institutional, historical, and issue-specific contexts that form our political views. He finds that grassroots organizations and local protests of ordinary people pushed demands for social change into the consciousness of the general public. From there, Lee argues, these demands entered the policy agendas of political elites. Evidence from multiple sources including survey data, media coverage, historical accounts, and presidential archives animate his argument.  Ultimately, Mobilizing Public Opinion is a timely, cautionary tale about how we view public opinion and a compelling testament to the potential power of ordinary citizens.","author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Taeku"}],"ISBN":"978-0-226-47025-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002,5]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"302","publisher":"University of Chicago Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Mobilizing Public Opinion: Black Insurgency and Racial Attitudes in the Civil Rights Era","title-short":"Mobilizing Public Opinion","type":"book"},

  {"id":"legewieRacialProfilingUse2016","abstract":"Racial profiling and the disproportionate use of police force are controversial political issues. I argue that racial bias in the use of force increases after relevant events such as the shooting of a police officer by a black suspect. To examine this argument, I design a quasi experiment using data from 3.9 million time and geocoded pedestrian stops in New York City. The findings show that two fatal shootings of police officers by black suspects increased the use of police force against blacks substantially in the days after the shootings. The use of force against whites and Hispanics, however, remained unchanged, and there is no evidence for an effect of two other police murders by a white and Hispanic suspect. Aside from the importance for the debate on racial profiling and police use of force, this research reveals a general set of processes where events create intergroup conflict, foreground stereotypes, and trigger discriminatory responses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Legewie","given":"Joscha"}],"container-title":"American Journal of Sociology","container-title-short":"American Journal of Sociology","DOI":"10.1086/687518","ISSN":"0002-9602","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,1]]},"page":"379-424","source":"www-journals-uchicago-edu.proxy.lib.uiowa.edu (Atypon)","title":"Racial Profiling and Use of Force in Police Stops: How Local Events Trigger Periods of Increased Discrimination","title-short":"Racial Profiling and Use of Force in Police Stops","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/687518","volume":"122"},

The validity of RMP is a point of debate; many would argue that self‐selection bias obscures the usefulness of RMP evaluations. In order to test this possibility, we collected three types of evaluations: RMP evaluations that existed at the beginning of our study, traditional in‐class evaluations and RMP evaluations that were prompted after we collected in‐class evaluations. We found differences in the types of evaluations students provide for their professors for both perceptions of professor clarity and ratings of professor easiness.

Excluded from almost all such analyses is any consideration of how those states became members of the international system in the first place. State making researchers, in contrast, focus on the formation experiences of states. Drawing on insights from both approaches, we argue that states with positive birth legacies should be more successful at state making and achieve more favorable outcomes than states without positive birth legacies. As fighting and winning wars are a common pathway to political development, states with positive birth legacies should be more likely to participate in and win interstate and civil wars. Statistical analyses of all states in the international system from 1816 to 2002 support our expectations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Lemke","given":"Douglas"},{"family":"Carter","given":"Jeff"}],"container-title":"The Journal of Politics","container-title-short":"The Journal of Politics","DOI":"10.1086/684631","ISSN":"0022-3816","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,2,9]]},"page":"497-511","source":"www-journals-uchicago-edu.proxy.lib.uiowa.edu (Atypon)","title":"Birth Legacies, State Making, and War","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/684631","volume":"78"},
  {"id":"lemonsRuleLawSharia2014","abstract":"In spring of 2011, Peter King (R-NY) convened a hearing titled ‘The Extent of Radicalization among American Muslims’ in the US House of Representatives. Democratic participants critiqued the hearings and contextualized the proceedings within the long history of institutionalized racism in the USA. They argued that the hearings were a threat to the Constitution itself, a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause and the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of religion. Republican participants shared concerns about threats to the Constitution but suggested that the hearings were part of a strategy to combat this threat. Numerous Republican participants identified forms of Islamic law, or sharia law, as the primary threat to the integrity of the rule of law (ROL). Despite opposing positions, all actors agreed that the ‘ROL’ is that which will save the nation from threats posed from both outside and inside the nation and, as such, it is the ROL itself that must be protected. In this sense, the ‘ROL’ ensured by the Constitution inadvertently became the primary object of the hearings. In this essay, we bring analytical approaches from performance studies and anthropology to argue that the hearings impel a re-examination of the concept of ‘ROL’ itself. Rather than simply addressing the legislative effects of the hearings, we are interested in what they reveal about the performative and cultural dimensions of the law and the lawmaking process. While critics of the hearings derisively referred to them as ‘political theater’, we suggest that it is the nature of the King Hearings as staged public spectacle that imbue them with a politically performative power. We also identify the specific effects of sharia panic in contemporary US American political and legal discourse.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Lemons","given":"Katherine"},{"family":"Chambers-Letson","given":"Joshua Takano"}],"container-title":"Cultural Studies","DOI":"10.1080/09502386.2014.886486","ISSN":"0950-2386","issue":"5-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,9,3]]},"page":"1048-1077","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Rule of law: Sharia panic and the US Constitution in the House of Representatives","title-short":"Rule of law","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/09502386.2014.886486","volume":"28"},

Beyond a very small number of exploratory studies of accounting practices underpinning these digital platform organisations, little is known about their governance and management control. This paper examines the governance and management control exercised by a digital platform owner over global users exhibited by Airbnb, a successful and pervasive sharing economy platform in the holiday accommodation sector. Through netnographic method, this study investigates the platform owner governance and control issues with respect to hosts. The analysis reveals the platform owner using predominantly formal bureaucratic control systems as mechanisms to govern and control its users. Through users’ compliance, they and their activities are made visible to the platform owner, which in turn maintains control over the value creation process. This study provides insights into how accounting systems are mobilised in digital platforms to facilitate their governance through mechanisms of surveillance, monitoring control over digital users worldwide, and how innovative and disruptive phenomena nonetheless rely on traditional technologies of governance to maintain power and control.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Leoni","given":"Giulia"},{"family":"Parker","given":"Lee D."}],"collection-title":"Innovative Governance and Sustainable Pathways in a Disruptive Environment","container-title":"The British Accounting Review","container-title-short":"The British Accounting Review","DOI":"10.1016/j.bar.2018.12.001","ISSN":"0890-8389","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"100814","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Governance and control of sharing economy platforms: Hosting on Airbnb","title-short":"Governance and control of sharing economy platforms","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890838918300829","volume":"51"},

  {"id":"leslieGRASSALWAYSGREENER","abstract":"Cultural, political and economic divisions between rural and urban communities are steadily growing in our nation. President Donald Trump’s surprising electoral victory was in part attributed to rural resentment. Previous scholars such as Katherine Cramer have studied rural residents’ perceptions of economic disadvantage, inattention from legislators, and cultural differences in comparison to urban residents. This paper will expand upon this research to analyze rural resentment as it pertains to perceptions of the national economy and vote choice in the 2008, 2012, and 2016 presidential elections. Statistical analyses revealed that rurality was correlated with pessimistic views of the national economy, particularly in 2012 and 2016. Further, among all economically pessimistic voters, rural voters were more inclined to vote for the Republican presidential candidate than urban voters in 2012 and 2016. The findings suggest that rural culture is something to be considered in analyzing political ideology.","author":[{"family":"Leslie","given":"Jillian"}],"language":"en","page":"36","source":"Zotero","title":"THE GRASS IS ALWAYS GREENER: THE ROLE OF RURALITY IN ECONOMIC PERCEPTIONS","type":"article-journal"},

The #AoIR2016 conference theme Internet Rules! invited participants to address the complex interplay of digital technologies, business models and user practices. For some, the Internet rules! Others are ruled by the internet. Reflecting the emergent focus during the conference, this special issue addresses the Internet as a set of connected platforms that have various technical, social, cultural, political and figurative meanings, and seeks to understand rules as a set of normative values. Offering a primer on platform values, the contributions share a commitment to social justice, offer innovative theoretical interventions and empirically ground the workings of platform values from various scholarly perspectives. They show how normative digitally networked technologies are mutually shaped by top-down decisions such as the profit-oriented workings of algorithms that differentially value some users over others and bottom-up user practices that both sustain and subvert value-laden mechanisms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Leurs","given":"Koen"},{"family":"Zimmer","given":"Michael"}],"container-title":"Information, Communication & Society","DOI":"10.1080/1369118X.2017.1295464","ISSN":"1369-118X","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,6,3]]},"page":"803-808","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Platform values: an introduction to the #AoIR16 special issue","title-short":"Platform values","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2017.1295464","volume":"20"},

Today’s hate crime laws are the refined modern progeny of an important class of remedial post–Civil War laws and constitutional amendments. Although the Supreme Court has vigorously upheld enhanced punishment for hate crimes over the last decade, it has also established restrictions on the government’s authority to punish bigoted conduct and expression. This article examines, through an analysis of historic cases, laws, and constitutional changes, the legal evolution that culminated in the passage of modern hate crime laws.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Levin","given":"Brian"}],"container-title":"Journal of Social Issues","DOI":"10.1111/1540-4560.00258","ISSN":"1540-4560","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002]]},"language":"en","page":"227-245","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"From Slavery to Hate Crime Laws: The Emergence of Race and Status-Based Protection in American Criminal Law","title-short":"From Slavery to Hate Crime Laws","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1540-4560.00258","volume":"58"},

  {"id":"levinsonPopularSovereigntyUnited2014","abstract":"The very title of Bruce Ackerman's now three-volume masterwork, We the People, signifies his commitment to popular sovereignty and, beyond that, to the embrace of democratic inclusion as the leitmotif of American constitutionalism. But \"popular sovereignty,\" not to mention \"democracy,\" has many conceptions, and there is a tension within Ackerman's overall project as to which of the varieties he is most comfortable with. The United States Constitution, though written (and ratified) in the name of \"We the People,\" nonetheless adopts a theory of \"representative democracy\" that is purposely designed to minimize to the vanishing point the ability of \"the people\" to have any direct role in making national-level political decisions. They are restricted to electing purported representatives, who will make decisions in their name, with or without genuine consultation. One can contrast this to American state constitutions, almost all of which include at least some aspect of direct democracy and many of which, with California being the most prominent example, allow vigorous popular participation in governance through initiative and referendum. So an obvious question is whether Ackerman simply feels constrained by the undoubted limits of the national Constitution — one lives with the Constitution one has, not the Constitution one might wish to have — or, on the contrary, whether he affirmatively embraces the particular crabbed form of popular sovereignty instantiated in the United States Constitution and rejects the more robust forms that are available not only in theory but also in the practices of many states (and foreign countries).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,5]]},"author":[{"family":"LEVINSON","given":"SANFORD"}],"container-title":"The Yale Law Journal","ISSN":"0044-0094","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"page":"2644-2674","source":"JSTOR","title":"Popular Sovereignty and the United States Constitution: Tensions in the Ackermanian Program","title-short":"Popular Sovereignty and the United States Constitution","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/43617003","volume":"123"},
  {"id":"levinsonSeparationPartiesNot2006","abstract":"American political institutions were founded upon the Madisonian assumption of vigorous, self-sustaining political competition between the legislative and executive branches. Congress and the President would check and balance each other; officeholders would defend the distinct interests of their different institutions; ambition would counteract ambition. That is not how American democracy turned out. Instead, political competition and cooperation along relatively stable lines of policy and ideological disagreement quickly came to be channeled not through the branches of government, but rather through an institution the Framers could imagine only dimly but nonetheless despised: political parties. Few aspects of the founding generation's political theory are now more clearly anachronistic than their vision of legislative-executive separation of powers. Yet few of the Framers' ideas continue to be taken as literally or sanctified as deeply by courts and constitutional scholars as the passages about interbranch relations in Madison's Federalist 51. This Article reenvisions the law and theory of separation of powers by viewing it through the lens of party competition. In particular, it points out that during periods - like the present - of cohesive and polarized political parties, the degree and kind of competition between the legislative and executive branches will vary significantly and may all but disappear, depending on whether party control of the House, Senate, and Presidency is divided or unified. The practical distinction between party-divided and party-unified government thus rivals, and often dominates, the constitutional distinction between the branches in predicting and explaining interbranch political dynamics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,9]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Levinson","given":"Daryl J."},{"family":"Pildes","given":"Richard H."}],"container-title":"Harvard Law Review","ISSN":"0017-811X","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006]]},"page":"2311-2386","source":"JSTOR","title":"Separation of Parties, Not Powers","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/4093509","volume":"119"},

  {"id":"levyFederalismLiberalismSeparation2007","abstract":"Federalism, when it has not been ignored altogether in normative political theory, has typically been analyzed in terms that fail to match the institution as it exists in the world. Federations are made up of provinces that are too few, too large, too rigid, too constitutionally entrenched, and too tied to ethnocultural identity to match theories based on competitive federalism, Tiebout sorting, democratic self-government, or subsidiarity. A relatively neglected tradition in liberal thought, based on a separation of loyalties and identifiable in Montesquieu, Publius, Constant, Tocqueville, and Acton, however, holds more promise. If the purpose of federalism is to compensate for worrisome tendencies toward centralization, then it is desirable that the provinces large enough to have political power be stable and entrenched and be able to engender loyalty from their citizens, such as the loyalty felt to ethnoculturally specific provinces. Separation of loyalty theories and the bulwark theories of which they are a subset match up with federalism as it exists in the world.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Levy","given":"Jacob T."}],"container-title":"American Political Science Review","DOI":"10.1017/S0003055407070268","ISSN":"1537-5943, 0003-0554","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,8]]},"language":"en","page":"459-477","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Federalism, Liberalism, and the Separation of Loyalties","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/federalism-liberalism-and-the-separation-of-loyalties/A3A4234BA4B1BD0809EE5029B065CDEE","volume":"101"},

  {"id":"levyRationalismPluralismFreedom2017","abstract":"Intermediate groups- voluntary associations, churches, ethnocultural groups, universities, and more-can both protect threaten individual liberty. The same is true for centralized state action against such groups. This wide-ranging book argues that, both normatively and historically, liberal political thought rests on a deep tension between a rationalist suspicion of intermediate and local group power, and a pluralism favorable toward intermediate group life, and preserving the bulk of its suspicion for the centralizing state. The book studies this tension using tools from the history of political thought, normative political philosophy, law, and social theory. In the process, it retells the history of liberal thought and practice in a way that moves from the birth of intermediacy in the High Middle Ages to the British Pluralists of the twentieth century. In particular it restores centrality to the tradition of ancient constitutionalism and to Montesquieu, arguing that social contract theory's contributions to the development of liberal thought have been mistaken for the whole tradition. It discusses the real threats to freedom posed both by local group life and by state centralization, the ways in which those threats aggravate each other. Though the state and intermediate groups can check and balance each other in ways that protect freedom, they may also aggravate each other's worst tendencies. Likewise, the elements of liberal thought concerned with the threats from each cannot necessarily be combined into a single satisfactory theory of freedom. While the book frequently reconstructs and defends pluralism, it ultimately argues that the tension is irreconcilable and not susceptible of harmonization or synthesis; it must be lived with, not overcome.","author":[{"family":"Levy","given":"Jacob T"}],"ISBN":"978-0-19-880891-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"English","note":"OCLC: 1012737624","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Rationalism, pluralism, and freedom","type":"book"},

The precipitants tend to be highly charged violations of one racial group by the other--rape, murder, assault, and police brutality. Since many of these precipitants are normally dealt with by established community institutions and because the response is not restricted to the alleged aggressor, various underlying conditions must be present. Hypotheses derived from earlier case studies and texts on collective behavior are examined to determine why riots occur where they do rather than in other cities of comparable size and location. Occupational and municipal government characteristics influence the occurrence of riots; demographic and housing characteristics do not.

We develop a general-equilibrium model to show that this unique vertical structure, when combined with openness and labor abundance, is critical in explaining a puzzling fact about China's economy: SOEs outperformed non-SOEs in the past decade while the opposite was true in the 1990s. We show how the upstream SOEs extract rents from the liberalized downstream sectors in the process of industrialization and globalization. It implies that the unusual prosperity of SOEs in China can be merely a growth-undermining symptom of the incompleteness of market-oriented reforms rather than a proof of their efficiency dominance over non-SOEs.

In a first, preparatory, step, it will be argued that determinate conceptions of truth, time and the giving and taking of reason underlie the process of acquiring a European community. These findings are confronted, in a second step, with Antonio Negri's theory of the multitude as a constituent power, which opposes revolutionary self-determination to representation. Deconstructing this massive opposition, this paper explores three ways in which representation is at work in revolutionary self-determination. As will become clear in the course of the debate, instituting (European) community turns on the interval linking and separating law ‘and’ disorganised civil society.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Lindahl","given":"Hans"}],"container-title":"European Law Journal","DOI":"10.1111/1468-0386.00185","ISSN":"1468-0386","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003]]},"language":"en","page":"433-450","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Acquiring a Community: The Acquis and the Institution of European Legal Order","title-short":"Acquiring a Community","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1468-0386.00185","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"lindquistSupremeCourtAuditing2006","abstract":"Using an aggregate-level model of Supreme Court–circuit court interactions, this study assesses the extent to which the Court’s auditing process of circuit court outputs is shaped by organizational dynamics such as structural capacity, institutionalization, and demographic characteristics. Principals in organizational hierarchies must audit the behavior of their agents to ensure that the agents are faithfully complying with the principals’ preferences. In the case of the Supreme Court, such auditing activities must take place in the face of very limited institutional capacity on the Court’s part. We propose that the Court considers certain broad organizational and institutional characteristics at the circuit level when performing this task. In particular, we ﬁnd that the Court strategically allocates its limited institutional resources to audit decisions to respond to its recent interactions with individual circuits in past terms, the circuits’ internal decision-making dynamics (including dissent and reversal rates), and goal conﬂict between the circuit and the Supreme Court.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Lindquist","given":"S.

  {"id":"linHomophilySpreadMisinformation2019","abstract":"The homophilous nature of online social network, a.k.a. “echo chambers”, is thought to be an important factor in the massive spread of misinformation online. However, a convincing test of the link between homophily and the spread of misinformation has been lacking due to confounding factors in observational studies, most notably the greater overall activity and political engagement of individuals in echo chambers. We tested it in a controlled experiment in which participants seek to share only messages they believe to be true, wherein the level of homophily in participant populations was independently varied. The experimental results revealed that contrary to predictions homophilous networks were less likely to propagate both true and false news messages. We reconcile this contrast by showing that the effect of homophily reverses when messages are relatively believable and of moderate political color.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Lin","given":"H."}],"genre":"Master thesis","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Utrecht University","title":"Homophily and the Spread of Misinformation Online","type":"thesis","URL":"http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/383539"},

Its aim is to make recommendations for use and interpretation based on more than 80 years of student ratings research. As more colleges and universities use student ratings data to guide personnel decisions, it is critical that administrators and faculty evaluators have access to research-based information about their use and interpretation. The article begins with an overview of common views and misconceptions about student ratings, followed by clarification of what student ratings are and are not. Next are two sections that provide advice for two audiences—administrators and faculty evaluators—to help them accurately, responsibly, and appropriately use and interpret student ratings data.

  {"id":"linWhyDoesDeep2017","abstract":"We show how the success of deep learning could depend not only on mathematics but also on physics: although well-known mathematical theorems guarantee that neural networks can approximate arbitrary functions well, the class of functions of practical interest can frequently be approximated through “cheap learning” with exponentially fewer parameters than generic ones. We explore how properties frequently encountered in physics such as symmetry, locality, compositionality, and polynomial log-probability translate into exceptionally simple neural networks. We further argue that when the statistical process generating the data is of a certain hierarchical form prevalent in physics and machine learning, a deep neural network can be more efficient than a shallow one. We formalize these claims using information theory and discuss the relation to the renormalization group. We prove various “no-flattening theorems” showing when efficient linear deep networks cannot be accurately approximated by shallow ones without efficiency loss; for example, we show that n variables cannot be multiplied using fewer than 2n2n2^n neurons in a single hidden layer.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Lin","given":"Henry W."},{"family":"Tegmark","given":"Max"},{"family":"Rolnick","given":"David"}],"container-title":"Journal of Statistical Physics","container-title-short":"J Stat Phys","DOI":"10.1007/s10955-017-1836-5","ISSN":"0022-4715, 1572-9613","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1223-1247","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Why Does Deep and Cheap Learning Work So Well?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10955-017-1836-5","volume":"168"},

The contagiousness of social content is highly depending on the size of of seed nodes and connectivity of the network. In this study, we propose the optimization problems of information content diffusion over social networks. The content here can be either useful information such as news, innovation ideas, and marketing purpose content or negative content such as misinformation and malicious rumors. We show that the optimization problem on information diffusion has been discussed in previous researches from different aspects using different approaches. In our study, we formulate two optimization problems—content spread maximization and misinformation minimization—which are both NP-hard and non-submodular. To tackle the difficulty of these problems we sandwich approximation which has data-dependent guarantees.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Yi"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Ruidong"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Weili"}],"collection-title":"Springer Optimization and Its Applications","container-title":"Nonlinear Combinatorial Optimization","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-16194-1_13","editor":[{"family":"Du","given":"Ding-Zhu"},{"family":"Pardalos","given":"Panos M."},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Zhao"}],"event-place":"Cham, CH-ZG","ISBN":"978-3-030-16194-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"273-284","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham, CH-ZG","source":"Springer Link","title":"Optimization on Content Spread in Social Network Studies","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-16194-1_13"},

I revisit the distinction between liberal and republican freedom and argue that republican freedom incorporates a particular rule-of-law requirement, whereas liberal freedom does not. Liberals may also endorse such a requirement, but not as part of their conception of freedom itself. I offer a formal analysis of this rule-of-law requirement and compare liberal and republican freedom on its basis. While I agree with Pettit that republican freedom has broader implications than liberal freedom, I conclude that we face a trade-off between two dimensions of freedom (scope and robustness) and that it is harder for republicans to solve that trade-off than it is for liberals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,18]]},"author":[{"family":"List","given":"Christian"}],"container-title":"Politics, Philosophy & Economics","container-title-short":"Politics, Philosophy & Economics","DOI":"10.1177/1470594X06064222","ISSN":"1470-594X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"201-220","publisher":"SAGE Publications","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Republican freedom and the rule of law","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1470594X06064222","volume":"5"},

I revisit the history of audience research to show how empirical findings contested the pejorative conception of the audience problematically yet persistently imagined by theorists of media power during the twentieth century. As media studies joins other disciplines in responding to the growing datafication of society, I propose that the circuit of culture model can help theorize media (including platform and algorithmic) power by opening up the hermeneutic and action space between production and consumption. In this way, critical scholarship might more effectively analyze such metaprocesses as mediatization and datafication precisely by recognizing rather than erasing audiences’ relation to both the everyday lifeworld and the public world of citizen action, regulatory intervention, and the wider society.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Livingstone","given":"Sonia"}],"container-title":"Television & New Media","DOI":"10.1177/1527476418811118","ISSN":"1527-4764, 1552-8316","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2]]},"language":"en","page":"170-183","source":"Crossref","title":"Audiences in an Age of Datafication: Critical Questions for Media Research","title-short":"Audiences in an Age of Datafication","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1527476418811118","volume":"20"},

Consequently slavery came to an end in England between the 1760s and the 1790s, not from the Somerset Case in 1772, nor from the Act of Parliament in 1833, but from the escape of the slaves themselves. Certain institutional elements, namely the traditions of household servitude, a popular libertarian political culture, and the ideology of the rule of law, provided a climate conducive to black resistance. Nonetheless, the initiative for ending slavery, the force which brought the institutional elements into play, came from individual members of the black community.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Lorimer","given":"Douglas A."}],"container-title":"Immigrants & Minorities","DOI":"10.1080/02619288.1984.9974577","ISSN":"0261-9288","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1984,7,1]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/02619288.1984.9974577","page":"121-150","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Black slaves and English liberty: A re‐examination of racial slavery in England","title-short":"Black slaves and English liberty","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/02619288.1984.9974577","volume":"3"},

Three main ideas have been especially prominent in the neorepublican literature. First and most important is the conception of a free person as one who does not live under the arbitrary will or domination of others. Second is the associated conception of a free state as one that attempts to promote the freedom of its citizens without itself coming to dominate them. And third is the conception of good citizenship as consisting in a vigilant commitment to preserving the state in its distinctive role as an undominating protector against domination. The aim of the neorepublican research program is to rethink issues of legitimacy and democracy, welfare and justice, public policy and institutional design, from within the framework that these basic ideas provide.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Lovett","given":"Frank"},{"family":"Pettit","given":"Philip"}],"container-title":"Annual Review of Political Science","container-title-short":"Annu.

  {"id":"lovettRepublicanTheoryAdjudication2015","abstract":"In recent years there has been a revival of interest in civic republicanism. In light of this revival, it is interesting to consider what sort of theory of legal or judicial adjudication such a doctrine—centered on the value of promoting freedom from domination—would recommend. After discussing the importance of such a theory and clarifying its relationship to broader questions of institutional design, it is argued that theories of adjudication should be assessed according to three criteria: first, their contribution to the republican cause of promoting freedom from domination; second, their suitability to the characteristic features of legal systems; and third, their impact on long-run institutional stability. According to these criteria, a republican theory of adjudication would hold that judges and other legal officials should strive in their decisions and interpretations to maintain and enhance the distinctive value of the rule of law.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Lovett","given":"Frank"}],"container-title":"Res Publica","container-title-short":"Res Publica","DOI":"10.1007/s11158-014-9257-7","ISSN":"1572-8692","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1-18","source":"Springer Link","title":"A Republican Theory of Adjudication","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11158-014-9257-7","volume":"21"},

This article analyzes why actors perceive different payoffs across the forums in which they participate, ranging from mutually beneficial games of cooperation to conflictual zero-sum games in which one actor's gain means another actor's loss. The authors develop hypotheses at the level of the individual, the forum, and the overall polycentric system and test them using survey data collected in three research sites: Tampa Bay, Florida; the Paraná River delta, Argentina; and the Sacramento–San Joaquin River delta, California. The empirical findings suggest that levels of conflict in policy forums are higher when the actors who participate in them are concerned with hot-button issues, when the forums have large and diverse memberships, and in systems with a long history of conflict. The results shed new light on the drivers of conflict and cooperation in complex governance systems and suggest ways to manage conflict.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Lubell","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Mewhirter","given":"Jack"},{"family":"Berardo","given":"Ramiro"}],"container-title":"Public Administration Review","DOI":"10.1111/puar.13159","ISSN":"1540-6210","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/puar.13159","page":"222-233","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The Origins of Conflict in Polycentric Governance Systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/puar.13159","volume":"80"},

  {"id":"lucykTakingStockSocial2017","abstract":"Background In recent decades, the social determinants of health (SDOH) has gained increasing prominence as a foundational concept for population and public health in academic literature and policy documents, internationally. However, alongside its widespread dissemination, and in light of multiple conceptual models, lists, and frameworks, some dilution and confusion is apparent. This scoping review represents an attempt to take stock of SDOH literature in the context of contemporary population and public health.\nMethods We conducted a scoping review to synthesize and map SDOH literature, informed by the methods of Arksey and O’Malley (2005). We searched 5 academic and 3 grey literature databases for “social determinants of health” and “population health” or “public health” or “health promotion,” published 2004–2014. We also conducted a search on “inequity” or “inequality” or “disparity” or “social gradient” and “Canad*” to ensure that we captured articles where this language was used to discuss the SDOH. We included articles that discussed SDOH in depth, either explicitly or in implicit but nuanced ways. We hand-searched reference lists to further identify relevant articles. Findings Our synthesis of 108 articles showed wide variation by study setting, target audience, and geographic scope, with most articles published in an academic setting, by Canadian authors, for policy-maker audiences. SDOH were communicated by authors as a list, model, or story; each with strengths and weaknesses. Thematic analysis identified one theme: health equity as an overarching and binding concept to the SDOH. Health equity was understood in different ways with implications for action on the SDOH.\nConclusions Among the vast SDOH literature, there is a need to identify and clearly articulate the essence and implications of the SDOH concept.

This study contributes to the debate by focusing on incidental exposure—an important mechanism through which people encounter political disagreement on Facebook. Drawing on a laboratory experiment, this study finds that Facebook-based incidental exposure to counter-attitudinal information does not have a direct effect on corrective political participation (e.g., persuading others online about politics). Exposure to this type of information does, however, have an indirect positive impact on corrective participation through the mediating effects of anxiety, as suggested by affective intelligence theory and appraisal theories of emotion. A moderated mediation model indicates that the indirect effect through anxiety is particularly strong among individuals who consider the issue personally relevant.

  {"id":"lupuRolePrecedentEuropean","abstract":"While political scientists have become increasingly interested in the output of international courts, they have paid little attention to the manner by which these courts justify their decisions and develop legal norms. We address these issues through a network analysis of European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) citations. We argue that, like domestic review courts, the ECtHR uses its legal justifications at least in part to convince “lower” (domestic) courts of the legitimacy of its judgments. Several empirical observations are consistent with this view. First, countryspecific factors do not determine the case-law on which the Court relies. Instead, it cites precedent based on the legal issues in the case. Second, the Court is more careful to embed judgments in its existing case law with respect to the more politically sensitive decisions. Third, the court embeds its judgments in case-law more when the respondent government is from a common law legal system where the courts traditionally rely more on similar justifications. In all, we conclude that the ECtHR by and large uses case law to justify its decisions in a way that is similar to domestic review courts. Finally, we highlight the utility of applying network analysis to further study the development of international legal norms.","author":[{"family":"Lupu","given":"Yonatan"},{"family":"Voeten","given":"Erik"}],"language":"en","page":"37","source":"Zotero","title":"The Role of Precedent at the European Court of Human Rights: A Network Analysis of Case Citations","type":"article-journal"},

China's rapid development has been based on extensive growth reliant on exports, low wages, environmental exploitation, and the manufacturing of cheap products. China's current plans identify paths to economic rebalancing through intensive growth driven by rising investment in new technologies and manufacturing processes, improved wages and skills, and improved worker and environmental protections. Two industries, automotive and information technology, demonstrate the experience of and opportunities for rebalancing. Both offer improved employment conditions with better wages, but continue to incorporate large swaths of low-wage employment with little protection for workers' health and the environment. Economic rebalancing in China, therefore, has so far only appeared in pockets. Institutional safeguards for wages and labor standards remain constrained by powerful alliances among multinational corporations, Chinese state-owned/private enterprises, and the Chinese state.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Lüthje","given":"Boy"},{"family":"McNally","given":"Christopher A."}],"genre":"Report","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,10]]},"language":"en-US","publisher":"Honolulu, HI: East-West Center","source":"scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu","title":"China's hidden obstacles to socioeconomic rebalancing","type":"report","URL":"http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/37612"},

At the same time, some have criticized a normatively affirmative bias in online participation research as well as a one-sided focus on observable user activity. This contribution addresses the ensuing call for a more nuanced understanding of online participation in general, and online political participation in particular. We differentiate the online participation concept based on a focus group study among 96 Internet users from a broad range of social backgrounds in Germany. We derive a framework of eight types of online (non-)participation along three conceptual axes: activity, agency, and social valence.

  {"id":"lyttkensMakingDirectDemocracy2018","abstract":"The specific way the Athenians set up their democracy presents both theoretical and empirical challenges. Decisions were taken by majority vote in the Assembly. To keep politicians in line, the Athenians first used ostracism, which however was replaced by the graphe paranomon around 415 BCE. The latter provided that anybody who had made a proposal in the Assembly could be accused of having made an unconstitutional suggestion, bringing a potentially severe penalty if found guilty. We know of 35 such cases between 403 and 322. During the fourth century the notion of illegality was extended to a mere question of political undesirability. Henceforth any decision by the Assembly could be overturned by the courts, but if the accuser failed to get at least 20% of the jury votes, he was punished instead. While these rules can be seen as a safeguard against bad decisions, they also provided the Athenian politicians with important information about the relative strength of their political support. This effect has not been analysed before, and it may help explain the relative stability of political life in classical Athens. Furthermore this analysis also contributes to our understanding of a curious but often overlooked fact, namely that the decrees of the Athenian Assembly to a great extent concerned honorary rewards, and the use of the graphe paranomon in turn was largely focussed on the honorary decrees.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Lyttkens","given":"Carl Hampus"},{"family":"Tridimas","given":"George"},{"family":"Lindgren","given":"Anna"}],"container-title":"Constitutional Political Economy","DOI":"10.1007/s10602-018-9263-4","ISSN":"1043-4062, 1572-9966","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,12]]},"language":"en","page":"389-412","source":"Crossref","title":"Making direct democracy work: a rational-actor perspective on the graphe paranomon in ancient Athens","title-short":"Making direct democracy work","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10602-018-9263-4","volume":"29"},

  {"id":"maccormickRhetoricRuleLaw2005","abstract":"When cases come before courts can we predict the outcome? Is legal reasoning rationally persuasive, working within a formal structure and using recognisable forms of arguments to produce predictable results? Or is legal reasoning mere ŕhetoric ́in the pejorative sense, open to use, and abuse, to achieve whatever ends unscrupulous politicians, lawyers and judges desire? If the latter what becomes of the supposed security of living under the rule of law? This book tackles these questions by presenting a theory of legal reasoning, developing the author's classic account given in Legal Reasoning and Legal Theory (OUP, 1978). It explains the essential role syllogism plays in reasoning used to apply the law, and the elements needed in addition to deductive reasoning to give a full explanation of how law is applied and decisions justified through the use of precedent, analogy and principle. The book highlights that problems of interpretation, classification and relevance will always arise when applying general legal standards to individual cases. In justifying their conclusions about such problems, judges need to be faithful to categorical legal reasons and yet fully sensitive to the particulars of the cases before them. How can this be achieved, and how should we evaluate the possible approaches judges could take to solving these problems? By addressing these issues the book asks questions at the heart of understanding the nature of law and the moral complexity of the rule of law.","author":[{"family":"MacCormick","given":"Neil"}],"collection-title":"A Theory of Legal Reasoning","ISBN":"0-19-101878-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005]]},"number-of-pages":"304","publisher":"OUP Oxford","title":"Rhetoric and The Rule of Law","title-short":"Rhetoric and The Rule of Law","type":"book","URL":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VG1CAgAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=rhetoric+and+the+rule+of+law&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api"},

  {"id":"macdonaldRaceNeighbourhoodContext2007","abstract":"Research has long identified racial differences in perceptions of criminal injustice. Given that race is confounded with neighbourhood context, it remains unclear the extent to which individual or neighbourhood attributes explain racial differences in these perceptions. This paper advances research on racial differences in perceptions of unjust police practices in the US by relying on a survey of 3000 residents in 53 Cincinnati neighbourhoods. A propensity score weighting approach is used to identify a model by which Whites and Blacks living in similar neighbourhood environments can be compared with each other. The results demonstrate that race remains a significant predictor of perceptions of unjust police practices, even after taking into account the ecological structuring of neighbourhoods and their perceived environmental context. These findings suggest that racial consciousness with regard to perceived injustices by the police is not purely a condition of personal or structural disadvantage. The implications of these findings for police reform efforts to mend minority relations in urban cities are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"MacDonald","given":"John"},{"family":"Stokes","given":"Robert J."},{"family":"Ridgeway","given":"Greg"},{"family":"Riley","given":"K.

  {"id":"mackinnonFosteringFreedomOnline2014","abstract":"\"Freedom of expression is a universal human right that applies equally to the internet as to the offline world. The goal of this report, the third in UNESCO Series on Internet Freedom, is to shed light on how Internet intermediaries - services that mediate online communication and enable various forms of online expression - both foster and restrict freedom of expression across a range of jurisdictions, circumstances, technologies, and business models. With the rise of Internet, intermediaries that play a mediating role on the internet between authors of content and audiences, UNESCO took a joint initiative, with the Open Society Foundations, the Internet Society, and Center for Global Communication Studies at the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for Communication, to examine this recent historical phenomenon and how it impacts on freedom of expression and associated fundamental rights such as privacy. The report's authors have studied the policies and practices of companies representing three intermediary types (internet service providers, search engines, and social networking platforms) across ten countries. The three case studies highlight challenges and opportunities for different types of intermediaries in respecting and protecting online freedom of expression. The research showed that Internet intermediaries are heavily influenced by the legal and policy environments of states, but they do have leeway over many areas of policy and practice affecting online expression and privacy. The findings also highlighted the challenge where many state policies, laws, and regulations are poorly aligned with the duty to promote and protect intermediaries' respect for freedom of expression. It is a resource which enables the assessment of internet intermediaries' decisions on freedom of expression, by ensuring that any limitations are consistent with international standards. The research also recommends specific ways that intermediaries and states can improve respect for internet users' right to freedom of expression. This rich material will be of great value to all stakeholders. This research also formed the foundation for a dedicated chapter in the publication World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development - Special Digital Focus 2015\"--Publisher's description.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,23]]},"author":[{"family":"MacKinnon","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Hickok","given":"Elonnai"},{"family":"Bar","given":"Allon"},{"family":"Lim","given":"Hae-in"},{"literal":"Unesco"},{"literal":"Division for Freedom of Expression and Media Development"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","note":"OCLC: 957558630","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Fostering freedom online: the role of internet intermediaries","title-short":"Fostering freedom online","type":"book","URL":"http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002311/231162e.pdf"},

  {"id":"mackRepresentingRaceCreation2012","abstract":"Representing the Race tells the story of an enduring paradox of American race relations, through the prism of a collective biography of African American lawyers who worked in the era of segregation. Practicing the law and seeking justice for diverse clients, they confronted a tension between their racial identity as black men and women and their professional identity as lawyers. Both blacks and whites demanded that these attorneys stand apart from their racial community as members of the legal fraternity. Yet, at the same time, they were expected to be \"authentic\"--that is, in sympathy with the black masses. This conundrum, as Kenneth W. Mack shows, continues to reverberate through American politics today. Mack reorients what we thought we knew about famous figures such as Thurgood Marshall, who rose to prominence by convincing local blacks and prominent whites that he was--as nearly as possible--one of them. But he also introduces a little-known cast of characters to the American racial narrative. These include Loren Miller, the biracial Los Angeles lawyer who, after learning in college that he was black, became a Marxist critic of his fellow black attorneys and ultimately a leading civil rights advocate; and Pauli Murray, a black woman who seemed neither black nor white, neither man nor woman, who helped invent sex discrimination as a category of law. The stories of these lawyers pose the unsettling question: what, ultimately, does it mean to \"represent\" a minority group in the give-and-take of American law and politics?","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Mack","given":"Kenneth W."},{"family":"Mack","given":"Kenneth Walter"}],"event-place":"Cambridge, UNITED STATES","ISBN":"978-0-674-06530-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"publisher":"Harvard University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, UNITED STATES","source":"ProQuest Ebook Central","title":"Representing the Race: The Creation of the Civil Rights Lawyer","title-short":"Representing the Race","type":"book","URL":"http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/uiowa/detail.action?docID=3301067"},
  {"id":"maclinCreatingAdviceTakingReinforcement1996","abstract":"Learning from reinforcements is a promising approach for creating intelligent agents. However, reinforcement learning usually requires a large number of training episodes. We present and evaluate a design that addresses this shortcoming by allowing a connectionist Q-learner to accept advice given, at any time and in a natural manner, by an external observer. In our approach, the advice-giver watches the learner and occasionally makes suggestions, expressed as instructions in a simple imperative programming language. Based on techniques from knowledge-based neural networks, we insert these programs directly into the agent‘s utility function. Subsequent reinforcement learning further integrates and refines the advice. We present empirical evidence that investigates several aspects of our approach and shows that, given good advice, a learner can achieve statistically significant gains in expected reward. A second experiment shows that advice improves the expected reward regardless of the stage of training at which it is given, while another study demonstrates that subsequent advice can result in further gains in reward. Finally, we present experimental results that indicate our method is more powerful than a naive technique for making use of advice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Maclin","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Shavlik","given":"Jude W."}],"container-title":"Machine Learning","container-title-short":"Machine Learning","DOI":"10.1023/A:1018020625251","ISSN":"0885-6125, 1573-0565","issue":"1-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[1996,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"251-281","source":"link-springer-com.proxy.lib.uiowa.edu","title":"Creating Advice-Taking Reinforcement Learners","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1018020625251","volume":"22"},

That discussion has often been taken to mean that this indifference is an inevitable consequence of modern democracy. Yet the mainly theoretical treatment of the problem in Democracy does not make such a strong claim, and should be read more as a warning of a possible danger than as a statement of a necessary result. The creation of an ethos of individualism as a substitute for citizenship is first fully described in Tocqueville's late work on the pre-revolutionary regime in France. There he shows that incapacity for citizenship emerged less from the march toward equality than from the resort to highly centralized administrative methods as an instrument of modernizing reform.

  {"id":"manziManagingMisinformationMarketplace2019","abstract":"In recent years, fake news has overtaken the internet. Fake news publishers are able to disseminate false stories widely and cheaply on social media websites, amassing millions of likes, comments, and shares, with some fake news even “trending” on certain platforms. The ease with which a publisher can create and spread falsehoods has led to a marketplace of misinformation unprecedented in size and power. People’s vulnerability to fake news means that they are far less likely to receive accurate political information and are therefore unable to make informed decisions when voting. Because a democratic system relies on an informed populace to determine how it should act, fake news presents a unique threat to U.S. democracy.\n\nAlthough fake news threatens democratic institutions, First Amendment protections for false speech present a significant obstacle for regulatory remedies. This Note explores the ways these speech protections interfere with the government’s ability to protect political discourse—the process that enables it to function effectively—and proposes that the government regulate journalists to ensure that people can rely on legitimate news media to receive accurate information.","author":[{"family":"Manzi","given":"Daniela C"}],"container-title":"Fordham Law Review","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"2623–2651","source":"Zotero","title":"Managing the Misinformation Marketplace: The First Amendment and the Fight Against Fake News","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://fordhamlawreview.org/issues/managing-the-misinformation-marketplace-the-first-amendment-and-the-fight-against-fake-news/","volume":"87"},

  {"id":"marchalJunkNewsInformation2019","abstract":"Today, an estimated 75% of the British public access information about politics and public life online, and 40% do so via social media. With this context in mind, we investigate information sharing patterns over social media in the lead-up to the 2019 UK General Elections, and ask: (1) What type of political news and information were social media users sharing on Twitter ahead of the vote? (2) How much of it is extremist, sensationalist, or conspiratorial junk news? (3) How much public engagement did these sites get on Facebook in the weeks leading up to the vote? And (4) What are the most common narratives and themes relayed by junk news outlets?\n\nTo answer these research questions, we collected 1.76 million tweets related to the UK General Elections using the Twitter Streaming API between 13th and 19th November. These were collected from 284,265 unique users using a list of 40 election-related hashtags associated with the primary political parties in the UK, the 2016 EU referendum, and the 2019 General Election itself. From this sample, we extracted 308,493 tweets containing a URL link, which pointed to a total of 28,532 unique URLs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Marchal","given":"Nahema"},{"family":"Kollanyi","given":"Bence"},{"family":"Neudert","given":"Lisa-Maria"},{"family":"Au","given":"Hubert"},{"family":"Howard","given":"Philip N."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,9]]},"language":"en-GB","publisher":"Oxford Internet Institute","title":"Junk News & Information Sharing During the 2019 UK General Election","type":"report","URL":"https://comprop.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/uk-election-memo-2019/"},

  {"id":"marichalPoliticalFacebookGroups2013","abstract":"This paper seeks to expand our understanding the dynamics of political SNSs by means of a content analysis of 250 politically oriented Facebook groups. Using Google Translate, I examine Facebook groups from 32 different countries in 23 different languages. Using grounded theory (Glaser and Strauss, 1967) and Goffman’s (1978) work on dramaturgy, I develop a theory of a digital front stage that helps explain how and why Facebook users create groups. This digital front stage is maintained, I argue, through the use of four sets of signifiers (expressivity, identity, signifiers and text length). Because Facebook is a nonymous (as opposed to anyonmous) environment, actors can seek to construct “hoped for possible (political) selves” (Markus and Nurius, 1986). Political Facebook groups allow for the performance of these “possible selves” through the formation of idealized political identities. In the conclusion, I discuss the implications of SNS applications like Facebook groups for the future of digital citizenship.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,17]]},"archive_location":"random","author":[{"family":"Marichal","given":"Jose"}],"container-title":"First Monday","DOI":"10.5210/fm.v18i12.4653","ISSN":"13960466","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,12,8]]},"language":"en","source":"journals.uic.edu","title":"Political Facebook groups: Micro-activism and the digital front stage","title-short":"Political Facebook groups","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/4653","volume":"18"},

These events draw attention to the evolving relationship(s) between state propaganda, populist conspiracy theorizing and mainstream news reporting. The proliferation of alternative information sources complicates attempts to verify relevant claims about WikiLeaks and/or Russia. In addition to the competing conspiracy theories promoted by fringe elements, major news organizations like MSNBC and FOX increasingly tailor their news products to satisfy different truth markets.

Stephen Marshall, in The City on the Hill from Below, interrogates the political thought of David Walker, Frederick Douglass, W. E. B. DuBois, James Baldwin, and Toni Morrison to reveal a vital tradition of American political theorizing and engagement with an American political imaginary forged by the City on the Hill. Originally articulated to describe colonial settlement, state formation, and national consolidation, the image of the City on the Hill has been transformed into one richly suited to assessing and transforming American political evil. The City on the Hill from Below shows how African American political thinkers appropriated and revised languages of biblical prophecy and American republicanism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Marshall","given":"Stephen H."}],"event-place":"Philadelphia, UNITED STATES","ISBN":"978-1-4399-0657-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"publisher":"Temple University Press","publisher-place":"Philadelphia, UNITED STATES","source":"ProQuest Ebook Central","title":"The City on the Hill from Below: The Crisis of Prophetic Black Politics","title-short":"The City on the Hill from Below","type":"book","URL":"http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/uiowa/detail.action?docID=712342"},

  {"id":"marshallReflectionsPower1969","abstract":"The author explains how his interest in rights, as they were established in the 18th and 19th centuries, led to an interest in the forms of power that emerged in the 20th. Theories about the innate vulnerability of mass democracy to assaults by autocratic power are discussed and the capacities of different kinds of rights to resist them are assessed. The conclusion reached is that civil rights are the strongest in this respect, so much so that they may be regarded as being themselves a form of power. There follows a discussion of Max Weber's concepts of yacht and Herrschaft. The ideas developed in the preceding argument are then applied to the balance of power in the American political system, and to `Black Power' and its rejection of the civil rights movement among and on behalf of Negro Americans. It is suggested that the aim of `Black Power' is to win directly for an alienated minority the position of strength which civil rights can give to the citizens in a democracy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Marshall","given":"T.

It is suggested that this is partly because urban design theory is not robustly based on a fully scientific underpinning. In so far as urban design theory appears to be scientific, it is in danger of being pseudo-scientific. This article explores the relationship between science and pseudo-science, and questions the extent to which urban design theory could be called pseudo-scientific, by considering the hypotheses underlying four classic urban design theory texts.

The authors recommend rejecting a narrow criterion-related approach to validity and adopting a broad construct-validation approach, recognizing that effective teaching and SETs that reflect teaching effectiveness are multidimensional; no single criterion of effective teaching is sufficient; and tentative interpretations of relations with validity criteria and potential biases should be evaluated critically in different contexts, in relation to multiple criteria of effective teaching, theory, and existing knowledge.

  {"id":"martelRemorseProductionTruth2010","abstract":"This article reflects on the confession as a traditional focal point of criminal law and penal theories. Specifically, it questions the privileged status traditionally conferred to the confession within the hierarchy of legal proof and punishment as a remnant of Christian influence which should be made visible. This reflection draws on the case of Robert Latimer, one of the few judicial cases historically to have polarized Canadian public opinion. After serving seven years in a federal penitentiary for the ‘mercy killing’ of his 12-year-old severally handicapped daughter, Saskatchewan farmer, Robert Latimer, was denied day parole by the National Parole Board of Canada on 5 December 2007. Despite in-prison psychological and parole reports confirming Latimer’s low risk to reoffend, parole board members denied his request on the apparent sole basis that he had not developed sufficient remorse. This case highlights how remorse, as a particular discursive transaction, is an obligatory passage point or an oral corroboration indispensable to complete the written demonstration (i.e. psychological and parole reports) of an offender’s successful integration of the ‘truth’ about her and her crime. Hence, remorse may constitute the only valuable way for offenders to re-take their place within the ritual of ‘Truth’ production.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Martel","given":"Joane"}],"container-title":"Punishment & Society","container-title-short":"Punishment & Society","DOI":"10.1177/1462474510376139","ISSN":"1462-4745","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"414-437","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Remorse and the production of truth","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1462474510376139","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"martenPoliticalBiasCourt","abstract":"Several countries practice a system where laymen, who lack legal education, participate in the judicial decision making. Yet, little is known about their potential inﬂuence on the court rulings. In Sweden lay judges (na¨mndema¨n) are aﬃliated with the political parties and appointed in proportion to political party representation in the last local elections. This paper investigates the inﬂuence of their partisan belonging when ruling in asylum appeals in the Migration Courts, where laymen are eﬀectively randomly assigned to cases. The results show that the approval rate is aﬀected by the policy position of the laymen’s political parties. In particular, asylum appeals are more likely to be rejected when laymen from the anti-immigrant party the Swedish Democrats participate, and less likely to be rejected when laymen from the Left Party, the Christian Democrats or the Green Party participate. This indicates that asylum seekers do not receive an impartial trial, and raises concerns that laymen in the courts can compromise the legal security in general.","author":[{"family":"Marten","given":"Linna"}],"language":"en","page":"43","source":"Zotero","title":"Political Bias in Court?

Without denying the important differences that distinguish ancient democratic Athens from modern democracy, I analyze the Athenian situation in light of Habermas's theory of deliberation, and argue that civic and individual liberties in Athens were democracy-enabling because they undergirded the exercise of collective political power. In Athens, the considerable respect accorded to the rule of law (as distinct from majority rule), legitimated private autonomy and created the circumstances that made collective self-government possible. Thus, this article contradicts the dichotomous approach to liberty held by some of the most prominent critics of Athens such as Isaiah Berlin and Benjamin Constant.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Maskivker","given":"Julia"}],"container-title":"The European Legacy","DOI":"10.1080/10848770.2010.528902","ISSN":"1084-8770","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,12,1]]},"page":"855-870","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Participation and Rights in Athenian Democracy: A Habermasian Approach","title-short":"Participation and Rights in Athenian Democracy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10848770.2010.528902","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"matanockHowInternationalActors2020","abstract":"International actors at times seek to help bring peace, democracy, and human rights. Studies of how international actors help enforce political bargains between incumbent governments and their domestic opponents are proliferating. They show that opposition groups have trouble trusting incumbents to adhere to the political bargains they strike because incumbents can use their familiarity with state institutions and can use their asymmetric hold on power during bargain implementation to violate terms by retaining more of the status quo than agreed. International actors can overcome these “reversion problems,” however, by using monitoring mechanisms (often focused on electoral campaigns) and incentives conditioned on compliance. Reversion problems, and enforcement by international actors as a solution, are common across issue areas—arising when domestic actors try to end civil conflict, open elections, and reduce repression—but the literatures in these issue areas have largely remained segregated. This review proposes advancing this research agenda by unifying them and (re)examining the conditions under which this solution works best.","author":[{"family":"Matanock","given":"Aila M"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","page":"29","source":"Zotero","title":"How International Actors Help Enforce Domestic Deals","type":"article-journal"},

We situate CivilServant in the political history of policy experiments and present design considerations for community participation, ethics, and replication. Based on two case studies of community-led experiments and public debriefings on the reddit platform, we share findings on community deliberation about experiment results.

Our conceptual point of departure is that Twitter follower networks tell us whether individuals prefer to be members of a group that receives one-sided political messages, or whether they tend to form politically heterogeneous clusters that cut across ideological lines. Methodologically, such connections are best studied by means of computer-aided quantitative research complemented by the sociocentric approach of network analysis. Our data date from September 2018. The findings for Poland do not support the hypothesis of clusters emerging along partisan lines. Likewise, the Hungarian case reveals sharp group divisions on Twitter, the nodes however are diverse and overlapping in terms of political leaning. The data suggest that exposure and segregation in follower networks are not necessarily based on partisanship.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Matuszewski","given":"Pawel"},{"family":"Szabó","given":"Gabriella"}],"container-title":"Social Media + Society","DOI":"10.1177/2056305119837671","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,1]]},"language":"en","title":"Are Echo Chambers Based on Partisanship?

  {"id":"mcchesneyDigitalDisconnectHow2013","abstract":"Celebrants and skeptics alike have produced valuable analyses of the Internet’s effect on us and our world, oscillating between utopian bliss and dystopian hell. But according to Robert W. McChesney, arguments on both sides fail to address the relationship between economic power and the digital world. McChesney’s award-winning Rich Media, Poor Democracy skewered the assumption that a society drenched in commercial information is a democratic one. In Digital Disconnect, McChesney returns to this provocative thesis in light of the advances of the digital age. He argues that the sharp decline in the enforcement of antitrust violations, the increase in patents on digital technology and proprietary systems and massive indirect subsidies and other policies have made the internet a place of numbing commercialism. A handful of monopolies now dominate the political economy, from Google, which garners a 97 percent share of the mobile search market, to Microsoft, whose operating system is used by over 90 percent of the world’s computers. Capitalism’s colonization of the Internet has spurred the collapse of credible journalism and made the Internet an unparalleled apparatus for government and corporate surveillance and a disturbingly antidemocratic force. In Digital Disconnect, Robert McChesney offers a groundbreaking critique of the Internet, urging us to reclaim the democratizing potential of the digital revolution while we still can.","author":[{"family":"McChesney","given":"Robert W."}],"event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-1-59558-867-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,3,5]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"320","publisher":"The New Press","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Amazon","title":"Digital Disconnect: How Capitalism is Turning the Internet Against Democracy","title-short":"Digital Disconnect","type":"book"},
  {"id":"mcclainHonestyStudentEvaluations2018","abstract":"Student evaluations of teaching (SETs) are an important point of assessment for faculty in curriculum development, tenure and promotion decisions, and merit raises. Faculty members utilise SETs to gain feedback on their classes and, hopefully, improve them. The question of the validity of student responses on SETs is a continuing debate in higher education. The current study uses data from two universities (n = 596) to determine whether and under what conditions students are honest on in-class and online SETs, while also assessing their knowledge and attitudes about SETs. Findings reveal that, while students report a high level of honesty on SETs, they are more likely to be honest when they believe that evaluations effectively measure the quality of the course, the results improve teaching and benefit students rather than the administration, and when they are given at the end of the term. Honesty on evaluations is not associated with socio-demographic characteristics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"McClain","given":"Lauren"},{"family":"Gulbis","given":"Angelika"},{"family":"Hays","given":"Donald"}],"container-title":"Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education","DOI":"10.1080/02602938.2017.1350828","ISSN":"0260-2938","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,4,3]]},"page":"369-385","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Honesty on student evaluations of teaching: effectiveness, purpose, and timing matter!","title-short":"Honesty on student evaluations of teaching","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/02602938.2017.1350828","volume":"43"},

  {"id":"mccoyTheoryPerniciousPolarization2019","abstract":"This article compares the dynamics of polarization in the eleven case studies analyzed in this special issue to draw conclusions about antecedents of severe political and societal polarization, the characteristics and mechanisms of such polarization, and consequences of severe polarization for democracy. We find that the emergence of pernicious polarization (when a society is split into mutually distrustful “Us vs. Them” camps) is not attributable to any specific underlying social or political cleavage nor any particular institutional make-up. Instead, pernicious polarization arises when political entrepreneurs pursue their political objectives by using polarizing strategies, such as mobilizing voters with divisive, demonizing discourse and exploiting existing grievances, and opposing political elites then reciprocate with similarly polarizing tactics or fail to develop effective nonpolarizing responses. We explain how the political construction of polarization around “formative rifts” (social or political rifts that arise during the fundamental formation/reformation of a nation-state), the relative capacity of opposing political blocs to mobilize voters versus relying on mechanisms such as courts or the military to constrain the executive, and the strategic and ideological aims of the polarizing actors contribute to the emergence of its pernicious form. We analyze the consequences for democracy and conclude with reflections on how to combat pernicious polarization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,26]]},"author":[{"family":"McCoy","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Somer","given":"Murat"}],"container-title":"The ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science","container-title-short":"The ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science","DOI":"10.1177/0002716218818782","ISSN":"0002-7162","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"234-271","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Toward a Theory of Pernicious Polarization and How It Harms Democracies: Comparative Evidence and Possible Remedies","title-short":"Toward a Theory of Pernicious Polarization and How It Harms Democracies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0002716218818782","volume":"681"},

  {"id":"mcgregorPoliticsPoliceAccountability2016","abstract":"Police brutality, a longstanding civil rights issue, has returned to the forefront of American public debate. A growing body of public health research shows that excessive use of force by police and racial profiling have adverse effects on health for African Americans and other marginalized groups. Yet, interventions to monitor unlawful policing have been met with fierce opposition at the federal, state, and local levels. On April 30, 2015, the mayor of Newark, New Jersey signed an executive order establishing a Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) to monitor the Newark Police Department (NPD). Using a mixed-methods approach, this study examined how advocates and government actors accomplished this recent policy change in the face of police opposition and after a 50-year history of unsuccessful attempts in Newark. Drawing on official public documents, news media, and interviews conducted in April and May 2015, I propose that: (1) a Department of Justice investigation of the NPD, (2) the activist background of the Mayor and his relationships with community organizations, and (3) the momentum provided by the national Black Lives Matter movement were pivotal in overcoming political obstacles to reform. Examining the history of CCRB adoption in Newark suggests when and where advocates may intervene to promote policing reforms in other US cities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"McGregor","given":"Alecia"}],"container-title":"Journal of Urban Health","container-title-short":"J Urban Health","DOI":"10.1007/s11524-015-9998-4","ISSN":"1468-2869","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"141-153","source":"Springer Link","title":"Politics, Police Accountability, and Public Health: Civilian Review in Newark, New Jersey","title-short":"Politics, Police Accountability, and Public Health","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11524-015-9998-4","volume":"93"},

However, most of what is known about policing in America derives from mainstream media sources and as such the experiences of people of color and more specifically Blacks, have largely been under reported. Ideally, an understanding of the history could help mend the current relationship. This study examines the magnitude of police brutality Blacks suffered during the 20th century, the differences in experience depending on rural or urban geographical locations and how the NAACP addressed the needs of individuals seeking their assistance. To gain insight into this phenomenon, content and thematic analyses were conducted on correspondence exchanged between individuals and the NAACP representing cases (N=93) from 1937 to 1965. The data shows the extent of police brutality during the time period studied. The police brutality included verbal abuse, intimidation, physical abuse of all types' imaginable, frivolous charges, arrests without trials, fines without charges and gruesome murders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,1]]},"author":[{"family":"McHellen","given":"Tymura L."}],"event-place":"United States -- District of Columbia","genre":"Ph.D.","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"116","publisher":"Howard University","publisher-place":"United States -- District of Columbia","source":"ProQuest","title":"Unmasking the Badge of White Power: A Content Analysis of Police Brutality Against Blacks from 1937 to 1965","title-short":"Unmasking the Badge of White Power","type":"thesis","URL":"http://search.proquest.com/docview/1620907511/abstract/D21D985507C94328PQ/1"},

These questionable uses may require NationBuilder to revise its ‘Acceptable Usage Policy’ and raises broader questions about the responsibilities of political technology firms to liberal democracy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"McKelvey","given":"Fenwick"}],"container-title":"Internet Policy Review","DOI":"10.14763/2019.4.1439","ISSN":"2197-6775","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Cranks, clickbait and cons: on the acceptable use of political engagement platformsCranks, clickbait and cons: on the acceptable use of political engagement platforms","title-short":"Cranks, clickbait and cons","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://policyreview.info/node/1439"},

  {"id":"mclaughlinImaginedPoliticsHow2019","abstract":"This article examines political transportation—the construction of mental models that represent a political world and result in the absorption and positioning of oneself within the constructed world. Specifically, we propose that when citizens become immersed in the political narrative crafted by a politician, they become more likely to see the political world as personally relevant and, subsequently, become more committed to supporting that candidate. Further, the degree of political immersion should depend upon which media platform a campaign message is delivered through. These expectations were tested using an experiment where partisans were exposed to a campaign message delivered in the form of a television ad, a political e-mail, or a series of tweets. Results demonstrate that Twitter was the least likely to lead to political immersion. Further, results provide support for our theoretical model, where there is an indirect effect of campaign messages on political attitudes and behavior through immersion and perceived personal relevance. Taken together, this study demonstrates the utility of applying the concept of narrative transportation to politics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,5]]},"author":[{"family":"McLaughlin","given":"Bryan"},{"family":"Velez","given":"John A."}],"container-title":"Social Science Computer Review","container-title-short":"Social Science Computer Review","DOI":"10.1177/0894439317746327","ISSN":"0894-4393","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"22-37","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Imagined Politics: How Different Media Platforms Transport Citizens Into Political Narratives","title-short":"Imagined Politics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0894439317746327","volume":"37"},

  {"id":"meckstrothStruggleDemocracyParadoxes2015","abstract":"When political factions compete over the right to act in the “people’s” name, who is to decide? This problem was left unresolved by the great seventeenth- and eighteenth-century theorists of popular sovereignty and their critics, and it is little closer to being solved today. This book defends a new democratic theory that finally provides an answer. It argues that familiar attempts to define democracy in terms of timeless principles or institutions can only fall into paradox when faced with struggles over democratic founding and change. The only solution is to begin instead from the act of democratic judgment, and to consider the conditions that an outcome would have to meet if it were to count as a case of the people deciding what it will mean to govern themselves in a democratic way. The only way to work this out without stacking the deck is then to show, in Socratic fashion, that some parties’ claims to speak for “the people” cannot hold up consistently even on their own terms. The book defends controversial interpretations of Plato, Kant, and Hegel to show how familiar portrayals of each as seeking to ground politics directly in metaphysical foundations obscures an important tradition of radically antifoundational argument in the history of political thought. And then it reworks this sort of argument in a thoroughly democratic direction to defend a historical and Socratic theory of democracy that advances an entirely new approach to contested notions of progress, popular sovereignty, and democratic change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Meckstroth","given":"Christopher"}],"ISBN":"978-0-19-021394-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,7,1]]},"language":"en_US","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"www.oxfordscholarship.com.proxy.lib.uiowa.edu","title":"The Struggle for Democracy: Paradoxes of Progress and the Politics of Change","title-short":"The Struggle for Democracy","type":"book","URL":"http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190213923.001.0001/acprof-9780190213923"},

I analyze two case studies from the summer of 2018 by considering the sentiments expressed in the review texts, the application of Yelp’s relevant policies, and the tactical adaptations of reviewers. The case studies evince a normative conflict over how the platform should treat viral criticism of this sort. While Yelp clearly cannot truly function as a laissez-faire public forum, its moderation criteria can be gamed, and its efforts evidently exclude a range of sentiments that some users find meaningful.

  {"id":"MeetTeamsKeeping2019","abstract":"I joined Google a year ago to lead its Trust and Safety organisation and to work with the thousands of people working to protect our users and make our products, from Gmail to Maps, more safe.Deciding what content is allowed on our platforms, while preserving people’s right to express themselves freely at the colossal scale we operate is a big responsibility. It means developing rules that we can enforce consistently on much-debated lines. It means balancing respect for diverse viewpoints and giving a platform to marginalised voices, while developing thoughtful policies to tackle egregious content. These values can often be in tension and the calls we make can be controversial. We feel the weight of our responsibility here and the impact of our decisions keenly. Our teams tackle a huge spectrum of online abuse, from petty scams, like the email from a “relative” stranded abroad needing a bank transfer to get home safely, to the utterly abhorrent, including child sexual abuse material (CSAM) online. We work across products like Search, which connects people to information hosted on the web, as well as across products we host, like Photos. Understanding the different parameters of the products we serve is vital to our work and policy development. Given that breadth, our team is diverse, comprising product specialists, engineers, lawyers, data scientists, ex-law enforcement officials and others. They work hand-in-hand around the world and with a global network of safety and subject matter experts. Our goal in the Trust and Safety team is to achieve both accuracy and scale in our work. That’s why we have people and technology working together—and we invest heavily in both. More and more, we use smart technology to detect problematic content hosted on our platforms, which is driving progress. Take violent extremism online. Where once we relied heavily on users to flag this content to us, today the majority of terrorist content we remove on Google products is first identified by our machines. We can then send this content to our language and subject matter experts, who swiftly and accurately review and remove content. We’ve also built systems that allow us to work in partnership with NGOs, other tech companies, and government Internet Referral Units, like Europol, to alert us to potentially problematic content.Other issues, like combating hate speech, require a different approach. I’m proud of the strong progress we’re making to tackle online hate, including through the European Commission’s Code of Conduct on hate speech. We’ve improved our speed and accuracy of review by creating a dedicated team of language specialists in the EU. But there are many distinct challenges here. Standards for what constitutes hate speech vary between countries, as does the language and slang that’s used. Making meaningful progress through automatic detection will take time, but we’re putting our best technology and people to the task.To give a sense of the scale of our efforts, in 2017, our team pulled down 3.2 billion ads that broke our policies; they also blocked 79 million ads designed to trick you into clicking on malware-laden sites. Between July and September 2018, YouTube removed over 7 million videos that broke its rules and blocked 224 million comments. Across other products like Drive, Photos and Blogger, in the past year, we took down over 38,000 pieces of hate speech and 160,000 pieces of violent extremism content. We also support tools like SafeSearch, which help you avoid explicit Search results.None of this work can be done in isolation and our partnerships are essential. Nor can our policies be static—we must be responsive to the world around us and take the guidance of experts. That’s why I’m in Brussels this week to share insights from our work in content moderation and to listen and learn from others. The message I’ll bring from Google is that we will be more transparent, accountable and frank about where we can improve. I have no doubt that 2019 will bring more challenges but rest assured that we will dedicate all the resources necessary to do our part. We’ll do all that we can, through technology and people, to meet and overcome the many challenges we face online, and to think beyond our corner of the internet.Editor’s note: Kristie Canegallo is speaking at CoMo Brussels, a conference about content moderation held at the European Parliament. Kristie’s background is in government, where she worked under Presidents Bush and Obama in a range of national security and domestic policy roles, including as President Obama’s Deputy Chief of Staff.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,5]]},"container-title":"Google","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,5]]},"language":"en","title":"Meet the teams keeping our corner of the internet safer","type":"webpage","URL":"https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/meet-teams-keeping-our-corner-internet-safer/"},

A wave of regulations to deal with the problem is brewing from Australia to the United States. But the issue is a deep one that regulations alone will not solve. To combat disinformation, we need to understand efforts to disinform – both upstream (where disinformation starts) and downstream (where and how it spreads). This is where the Global Disinformation Index (GDI) has set its focus. \nFor the GDI, financial motivation is a connecting point that links together the upstream and downstream components of disinformation. To substantially reduce disinformation, we need to disrupt its funding and remove the financial incentive to disinform. This means turning our attention to the ad-tech industry. Ad-tech has inadvertently thrown a funding line to disinformation domains through online advertising. Until now, there has been no way for advertisers to know the disinformation risk of the domains carrying their ads. The GDI aims to change this state of affairs. The paper that follows explains why this shift is needed – and how the GDI can trigger it.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Melford","given":"Clare"},{"family":"Fagan","given":"Craig"}],"genre":"Global Disinformation Index Report","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5]]},"language":"en","page":"27","publisher":"Global Disinformation Index","title":"Cutting the Funding of Disinformation: The Ad-Tech Solution","type":"report","URL":"https://disinformationindex.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GDI_Report_Screen_AW2.pdf"},

Constitutions are found to vary in their degree of interpretability. Surprisingly, however, the most important determinants of variance are not contextual (for example, era, language or culture), but textual.

There are many reasons for this, not least of which are powerful local interests in perpetuating weak government institutions, facilitating corruption and other illicit activities. But some notable successes have occurred at the local level, both with formal and informal governance mechanisms. Municipalities have been particularly effective sources of formal governance in Somalia’s failed state, providing basic security and services via legitimate and responsive local authorities. In addition, informal hybrid governance arrangements, drawing on a combination of customary authority, sharia courts, business leaders, women’s market groups, and professionals, have been a critical source of routinized, legitimate governance and rule of law in Somalia. External actors have struggled to understand these arrangements and their place in wider state-building efforts. Where external aid has helped with local and informal governance in Somalia, it has been carefully calibrated and based on close contextual knowledge, not template-driven projects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Menkhaus","given":"Ken"}],"container-title":"The ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science","container-title-short":"The ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science","DOI":"10.1177/0002716214547002","ISSN":"0002-7162","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"154-172","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"State Failure, State-Building, and Prospects for a “Functional Failed State” in Somalia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0002716214547002","volume":"656"},

  {"id":"merceaPlatformPoliticsEurope2019","abstract":"In this article, we explore the process of movement social learning on Twitter. Previously described as the diffusion and social validation of innovation pertaining to collective outcomes through the practice of retweeting, movement social learning is unpicked with a combination of trace and interview data. We examine language use in retweets associated with the UK People’s Assembly Against Austerity with the aim to form an understanding of how such learning is cued.

The essay examines several recent examples of dangerous demagogues using weaponized communication strategies, including conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, President Donald Trump, and Neo-Nazi Andrew Anglin.

  {"id":"meseroleHowMisinformationSpreads2018","abstract":"“We take misinformation seriously,” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote just weeks after the 2016 election. In the year since, the question of how to counteract the damage done by “fake news” has become a pressing issue both for technology companies and governments across the globe.\n\nYet as widespread as the problem is, opportunities to glimpse misinformation in action are fairly rare.  Most users who generate misinformation do not share accurate information too, so it can be difficult to tease out the effect of misinformation itself. For example, when President Trump shares misinformation on Twitter, his tweets tend to go viral. But they may not be going viral because of the misinformation: All those retweets may instead owe to the popularity of Trump’s account, or the fact that he writes about politically charged subjects. Without a corresponding set of accurate tweets from Trump, there’s no way of knowing what role misinformation is playing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Meserole","given":"Chris"}],"container-title":"Lawfare","genre":"Blog","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,9]]},"language":"EN","title":"How misinformation spreads on social media—And what to do about it","type":"post-weblog","URL":"https://www.lawfareblog.com/how-misinformation-spreads-on-social-media-and-what-to-do-about-it"},

  {"id":"mewhirterInstitutionalExternalitiesActor2018","abstract":"This article examines the relationship between institutional externalities and an actor's ability to achieve their goals in the decision-making forums that exist in polycentric governance systems. We argue that an actor's performance is largely a function of the transaction costs associated with participation in a variety of forums. Institutional externalities—instances where the decisions made in one forum impact another forum—may increase or decrease transaction costs in linked forums, subsequently impacting actor performance. Using survey data collected from forum participants in the California Delta and Tampa Bay watershed governance systems, we examine how the strength of perceived externalities generated between linked forums affects an individual's perceived performance in the forum receiving the externality. We find that externalities are prevalent in both systems, but have varying effects on performance. Externalities, on average, negatively impact actor performance in the California Delta, but neither increase nor decrease performance in Tampa Bay. Further analyses reveal that in both systems, the effect of externalities on performance in the externality-receiving forum is largely conditional on their performance in the externality-generating forum. Externalities are negatively associated with forum performance when actors exhibit low levels of performance in the externality-generating forum. The negative effect is mitigated when actors exhibit higher levels of performance in the externality-generating forum.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Mewhirter","given":"Jack"},{"family":"Lubell","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Berardo","given":"Ramiro"}],"container-title":"Environmental Policy and Governance","DOI":"10.1002/eet.1816","ISSN":"1756-9338","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/eet.1816","page":"295-307","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Institutional externalities and actor performance in polycentric governance systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eet.1816","volume":"28"},

  {"id":"michelmanLawRepublic1988","abstract":"Recent years have witnessed several proposals to reconsider American constitutionalism in light of the \"civic republican\" strain identified by historians in the political thought of the founding era. This new republicanism must meet (among others) two objections. First, that traditional republicanism was a solidaristic doctrine presupposing a degree of moral consensus that is nonexistent in a modern, diverse, liberal society. Second, that it was a majoritarian doctrine of popular legislative supremacy that is fundamentally incompatible with the modern constitutionalist aim of securing, by judicially enforced higher law, individual rights against political oppression. Professor Michelman takes up these two objections to the \"republican revival,\" contending that only through a modern reconsideration of republican constitutional thought can we hope to make sense for our age of Americans' persistent beliefs and avowals that political liberty calls for both \"a government of the people, by the people\" and \"a government of laws and not of men.\" Drawing support from both traditional republican sources and contemporary readings, the author argues that these two demands are jointly satisfiable only by ideally conceiving of both legislative politics and constitutional adjudication as forms of self-revisionary normative dialogue through which personal moral freedom is also achieved. Using Bowers v. Hardwick as an example, he suggests that such a dialogic-republican constitutional theory can inspire stronger judicial protection of individual rights than do competing theories.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Michelman","given":"Frank"}],"container-title":"The Yale Law Journal","DOI":"10.2307/796539","ISSN":"0044-0094","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[1988]]},"page":"1493-1537","source":"JSTOR","title":"Law's Republic","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/796539","volume":"97"},

If community policing is to prevail as an effective and credible style of law enforcement, the legitimate use of competent police authority will continue to be a vital issue. This article analyzes the types of officer problems and problem officers that can harm community policing efforts. These include (1) individual factors, such as attitudes, personality traits, and psychological disorders; (2) police-citizen interaction factors, such as interpersonal dynamics and community attitudes; and (3) organizational factors, such as training and supervision, departmental philosophy, and the “cop culture.” The article then offers practical strategies for improving officer performance, including (1) selection and screening of officers; (2) training and supervision; (3) fitnessfor-duty evaluations; (4) effective supervision and discipline; (5) coaching and counseling strategies; and (6) the most productive use of psychological services.

  {"id":"millerInvisibleBlackVictim2010","abstract":"The promise of civil rights is the promise of inclusion; yet the vast disparity in incarceration rates between blacks, Latinos, and whites stands as an ugly reminder of the nation's long history of race-based exclusionary practices. In this article, I argue that an important aspect of understanding race and the law in the twenty-first century is an appreciation of the American federal system that structures legal authority, political mobilization, and policy solutions and serves as an important and overlooked obstacle to more complete and sustained racial equality in crime and punishment in the United States. In contrast to the conventional wisdom about the role of the national government in protecting the rights of minorities and other disadvantaged groups, I suggest that crime and justice are arenas where the nationalization of issues has left the most important constituents behind. In fact, local crime politics provides a space where there is regular and ongoing articulation of the inclusionary goals of the civil rights agenda and sustained efforts to move forward in realizing that agenda through meaningful community involvement in promoting public safety, economic development, and social justice. This article explores these themes and offers a discussion of the linkages between federalism, racial inequality and crime, victimization and punishment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Miller","given":"Lisa L."}],"container-title":"Law & Society Review","DOI":"10.1111/j.1540-5893.2010.00423.x","ISSN":"1540-5893","issue":"3-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"language":"en","page":"805-842","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The Invisible Black Victim: How American Federalism Perpetuates Racial Inequality in Criminal Justice","title-short":"The Invisible Black Victim","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-5893.2010.00423.x","volume":"44"},

Indeed, if there has been a running theme in most legal histories of the Ottoman Empire, it is that the best way to define Ottoman law is by explaining what it is not.

I then provide a framework for understanding the exceptional status of the US by exploring the fragmented, racialized and legalistic institutions of American politics and the role they play in producing a range of socio-economic insecurities.

Here, we draw on Hardin's theory of the tragedy of the commons and Ostrom's theory of polycentric governance to introduce a unifying theory of polycentric information commons that explains these phenomena. Further, our theory illuminates how polycentric governance principles, as manifested in system rules and infrastructure features, counterbalance various sustain-ability threats arising from unrestricted participation. By integrating previous research findings and offering new insights into information and governance practices, the theory, practically applied, can enhance the likelihood of sustained participation across diverse, decentralized online information systems. We conclude by discussing how researchers can use the theory in empirical investigations and how they can engage in theoretical elaborations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Mindel","given":"Vitali"},{"family":"Mathiassen","given":"Lars"},{"family":"Rai","given":"Arun"}],"container-title":"MIS Quarterly","container-title-short":"MIS Q.","DOI":"10.25300/MISQ/2018/14015","ISSN":"0276-7783","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,1]]},"page":"607–632","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"The sustainability of polycentric information commons","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.org/10.25300/MISQ/2018/14015","volume":"42"},

  {"id":"mirzaPatriciaWilliamsInflecting","abstract":"Critical Race Theory (C.R.T.) has developed out of a deep dissatisfaction that many black legal scholars in the U.S. felt with liberal civil rights discourse, a discourse premised upon the ideals of assimilation, ‘colour-blindness’ and integration. In addition, the emergence of the Critical Legal Studies movement provided Critical Race theorists with an innovative lexicon and practice which allowed them to develop a critique of traditional race analysis and U.S. law. Patricia Williams has played a key role in the formation of the C.R.T. movement and is concerned with many of the C.R.T. themes: the understanding that traditional civil rights law has beneﬁted whites more than blacks, the ‘call to context’, and the critique of liberalism by the assertion that racism is routine and not aberrational. Following the C.R.T. belief that form and substance are connected, Williams has also extended the boundaries of another C.R.T. theme by (largely) eschewing the conventional genre of legal writing in much of her work, including her two books, The Alchemy of Race and Rights and The Rooster’s Egg. This was one of the issues Williams discussed in an interview that commenced when she visited Britain in 1997 to deliver the Reith Lectures.","author":[{"family":"Mirza","given":"Qudsia"}],"language":"en","page":"22","source":"Zotero","title":"Patricia Williams: Inflecting Critical Race Theory","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"molyneuxAggregationClickbaitTheir2019","abstract":"Many journalists and industry observers lament that aggregating news underneath sensational headlines will erode credibility and turn off readers. While some scholarly work has studied journalists’ perspectives of this practice, little has been done to understand what audiences think of aggregation and clickbait. This study uses published original and aggregated news articles as stimuli in two online experiments to test readers’ perceptions of news aggregation and clickbait. Aggregation itself has little effect on perceptions of credibility and quality; instead, writing proficiency is more closely linked to these perceptions. Results also suggest clickbait headlines may lower perceptions of credibility and quality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Molyneux","given":"Logan"},{"family":"Coddington","given":"Mark"}],"container-title":"Journalism Practice","DOI":"10.1080/17512786.2019.1628658","ISSN":"1751-2786","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,16]]},"source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Aggregation, Clickbait and Their Effect on Perceptions of Journalistic Credibility and Quality","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/17512786.2019.1628658"},

  {"id":"morefieldStatesAreNot2005","abstract":"This essay examines the relationship between democratic theory and historical critiques of state sovereignty by analyzing Harold Laski's geneological approach to the history of political thought. This approach led Laski to conclude that the apparently \"unified\" character of soveriegn statehood made differences within states invisible, rendered similarities across states meaningless, obscured the liberal state's connections to capitalism, and supported order and authority over the less predictable qualities of democratic freedom. Laski's critique of sovereignty ultimately suggested that true democracy was impossible within the context of sovereingty and that real \"international cooperation\" could only happen under conditions in which individual states were prevented from speaking in the unified voice of their people. The esssay suggests that contemporary democratic theorists and international ethicists could have much to learn from Laski's refusal to relegate democracy to the internal boundaries of states.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Morefield","given":"Jeanne"}],"container-title":"Political Research Quarterly","DOI":"10.2307/3595651","ISSN":"1065-9129","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005]]},"page":"659-669","source":"JSTOR","title":"States Are Not People: Harold Laski on Unsettling Sovereignty, Rediscovering Democracy","title-short":"States Are Not People","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3595651","volume":"58"},

  {"id":"moroniUrbanDensityJane2016","abstract":"Background:  In the early part of the twentieth century, planning theory and practice always voiced strong opposition to density. The error of this insistence was persuasively argued by Jane Jacobs in the 1960s. Subsequently, planning theory and practice came to recognise the importance of density, but this return to favour requires remaining constantly alert to the possible dangers and pitfalls.\nMethods:  Critically considering the traditional and contemporary urban planning literature and the empirical evidence in the recent economic and geographical research, this article investigates the whys and wherefores of density in urban planning. It addresses two main questions: Is urban density really desirable (and why)? Is it effectively manageable (and how)?\nResults:  Density per se is meaningless unless it is a tool or condition for achieving something further. And even if the instrumental function of density were to be acknowledged, it is crucial to take into account that density is not solely (or merely) a tool which—in certain conditions—can be useful in reducing commute times and minimising the encroachment on undeveloped land. Its primary advantage concerns favouring the concentrated diverse admix of human preferences, tastes, abilities, know-how, uses, activities, and so forth.\nConclusions:  After having expressly laboured to avoid it for so long, the aim is not to create density directly, but to open the door and allow density to happen in our cities, thanks to more abstract and general planning rules.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Moroni","given":"Stefano"}],"container-title":"City, Territory and Architecture","DOI":"10.1186/s40410-016-0041-1","ISSN":"2195-2701","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,12]]},"language":"en","source":"Crossref","title":"Urban density after Jane Jacobs: the crucial role of diversity and emergence","title-short":"Urban density after Jane Jacobs","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://cityterritoryarchitecture.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40410-016-0041-1","volume":"3"},

The violence forced the federal government to intervene, bringing victory for the movement. I challenge this thesis by examining the tactics and mobilization tools of the Birmingham movement. Evidence indicates that the local movement, because of its capacity for mobilization and its use of multiple tactics, generated the power that led to victory. A general discussion of social movement tactics derives from this case study.

If workers and unions hope to achieve fundamental changes, not just incremental advances, they should learn from the civil rights movement. The civil rights movement indicates that workers’ rights can be won only if workers launch a mass movement, take risks, engage in direct action, demonstrate an ability to disrupt the normal functioning of society, and maintain that disruption until concessions are won.

It argues that the civil rights movement was able to overthrow the Southern Jim Crow regime because of its successful use of mass nonviolent direct action. Because of its effectiveness and visibility, it served as a model that has been utilized by other movements both domestically and internationally. Prior to the civil rights movement social movement scholars formulated collective behavior and related theories to explain social movement phenomena. These theories argued that movements were spontaneous, non-rational, and unstructured. Resource mobilization and political process theories reconceptualized movements stressing their organized, rational, institutional and political features. The civil rights movement played a key role in generating this paradigmatic shift because of its rich empirical base that led scholars to rethink social movement phenomena.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Morris","given":"Aldon D."}],"container-title":"Annual Review of Sociology","DOI":"10.1146/annurev.soc.25.1.517","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1999]]},"page":"517-539","source":"Annual Reviews","title":"A RETROSPECTIVE ON THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT: Political and Intellectual Landmarks","title-short":"A RETROSPECTIVE ON THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.soc.25.1.517","volume":"25"},

  {"id":"moscoSocialMediaJournalism2019","abstract":"Among the many problems facing contemporary journalism, one stands out most in my mind: social media firms, especially Google and Facebook, have decimated the business model that provided journalism with most of its revenue. For many years, journalism thrived by delivering readers to advertisers who paid for their attention, on the expecta- tion that this would translate into purchases of their goods and services. Today, Google controls about 40 percent of the digital advertising market in the United States and 44 percent worldwide, whereas Facebook takes in about 20 percent of the US market and 18 percent worldwide (eMarketer, 2017; Marketing Charts, 2017). These figures have been relatively steady for the past 4 years, meaning that two firms comfortably operate a duopoly over the most lucrative ad markets in the world. Meanwhile, newspapers con- tinue to experience declines in their share of both print and online advertising, leading to cutbacks in support for journalism and outright closures of newspapers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Mosco","given":"Vincent"}],"container-title":"Journalism","container-title-short":"Journalism","DOI":"10.1177/1464884918807611","ISSN":"1464-8849","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"181-184","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Social media versus journalism and democracy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1464884918807611","volume":"20"},

Khalil Gibran Muhammad chronicles how, when, and why modern notions of black people as an exceptionally dangerous race of criminals first emerged.

In this illuminating book, Muhammad shifts our attention to the urban North as a crucial but overlooked site for the production and dissemination of those ideas and practices.\" \"Following the 1890 census - the first to measure the generation of African Americans born after slavery - crime statistics, new migration and immigration trends, and symbolic references to America as the promised land were woven into a cautionary tale about the exceptional threat black people posed to modern urban society.

In response, it makes the argument for polycentric democracy, a political arrangement consisting of various political units that enjoy different degrees of independence. It is argued that to progress towards justice, we first need to change our attitude towards reasonable disagreement. Theorists have always viewed reasonable disagreement as nuisance, if not as a threat. However, this work puts forward that the diversity of perspectives which underlie reasonable disagreement, should be viewed as a resource to be harvested rather than a threat to be tamed. Resting on two key arguments, the author proposes the idea of polycentric democracy as the most capable method of making pluralism productive. The book explores what such a political order might look like and concludes that only an institutional system which is capable of profiting from diversity, such as polycentric democracy, might reasonably be expected to generate an overlapping consensus. Continuing in the tradition of Karl Popper and Friedrich A. Hayek, this book lies at the intersection of philosophy, political economy and political theory. It will be of great interest to academics and scholars working in philosophy, politics and economics\"--","author":[{"family":"Müller","given":"Julian F."}],"call-number":"JC423 .M7856 2019","collection-number":"258","collection-title":"Routledge frontiers of political economy","event-place":"Abingdon, Oxon ; New York, NY","ISBN":"978-1-138-22896-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"publisher":"Routledge","publisher-place":"Abingdon, Oxon ; New York, NY","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Political pluralism, disagreement and justice: the case for polycentric democracy","title-short":"Political pluralism, disagreement and justice","type":"book"},

  {"id":"mullinixPartisanshipPreferenceFormation2016","abstract":"An enduring and increasingly acute concern—in an age of polarized parties—is that people’s partisan attachments distort preference formation at the expense of relevant information. For example, research suggests that a Democrat may support a policy proposed by Democrats, but oppose the same policy if proposed by Republicans. However, a related body of literature suggests that how people respond to information and form preferences is distorted by their prior issue attitudes. In neither instance is information even-handedly evaluated, rather, it is interpreted in light of partisanship or existing issue opinions. Both effects are well documented in isolation, but in most political scenarios individuals consider both partisanship and prior opinions—yet, these dynamics may or may not pull toward the same preference. Using nationally representative experiments focused on tax and education policies, I introduce and test a theory that isolates when: partisanship dominates preference formation, partisanship and issue opinions reinforce or offset each other, and issue attitudes trump partisanship. The findings make clear that the public does not blindly follow party elites. Depending on elite positions, the level of partisan polarization, and personal importance of issues, the public can be attentive to information and shirk the influence of party elites. The results have broad implications for political parties and citizen competence in contemporary democratic politics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Mullinix","given":"Kevin J."}],"container-title":"Political Behavior","container-title-short":"Polit Behav","DOI":"10.1007/s11109-015-9318-4","ISSN":"1573-6687","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"383-411","source":"Springer Link","title":"Partisanship and Preference Formation: Competing Motivations, Elite Polarization, and Issue Importance","title-short":"Partisanship and Preference Formation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11109-015-9318-4","volume":"38"},
  {"id":"mummoloMilitarizationFailsEnhance2018","abstract":"The increasingly visible presence of heavily armed police units in American communities has stoked widespread concern over the militarization of local law enforcement. Advocates claim militarized policing protects officers and deters violent crime, while critics allege these tactics are targeted at racial minorities and erode trust in law enforcement. Using a rare geocoded census of SWAT team deployments from Maryland, I show that militarized police units are more often deployed in communities with large shares of African American residents, even after controlling for local crime rates. Further, using nationwide panel data on local police militarization, I demonstrate that militarized policing fails to enhance officer safety or reduce local crime. Finally, using survey experiments—one of which includes a large oversample of African American respondents—I show that seeing militarized police in news reports may diminish police reputation in the mass public. In the case of militarized policing, the results suggest that the often-cited trade-off between public safety and civil liberties is a false choice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Mummolo","given":"Jonathan"}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc Natl Acad Sci USA","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1805161115","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"37","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,11]]},"language":"en","page":"9181-9186","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Militarization fails to enhance police safety or reduce crime but may harm police reputation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1805161115","volume":"115"},

I describe these changes through a theoretical analysis of the economic structure of the industry and explore the implications for scholars of online media and politics. The crux of my argument is that social media simultaneously serves as a distribution platform and reputation builder, as social recommendations take the place of expensive investments in high-quality journalism. This development rendered crucial portions of previous models of the market for news inaccurate due to the declining importance of firm reputation. This mechanism interacts with the massive heterogeneity in digital literacy and growing animosity toward the news media among conservatives to create “credibility cascades,” which I argue are a necessary condition for Fake News to flourish.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Munger","given":"Kevin"}],"container-title":"Political Communication","DOI":"10.1080/10584609.2019.1687626","ISSN":"1058-4609","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,3]]},"source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"All the News That’s Fit to Click: The Economics of Clickbait Media","title-short":"All the News That’s Fit to Click","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10584609.2019.1687626"},

Using data taken from the Twitter accounts of Venezuelan legislators during the 2014 anti-Maduro protests in Venezuela, we fit a topic model on the text of the tweets and analyze patterns in hashtag use by the two coalitions. We argue that the regime’s best strategy in the face of an existential threat like the narrative developed by La Salida and promoted on Twitter was to advance many competing narratives that addressed issues unrelated to the opposition’s criticism. Our results show that the two coalitions pursued different rhetorical strategies in keeping with our predictions about managing the conflict advanced by the protesters. This article extends the literature on social media use during protests by focusing on active engagement with social media on the part of the regime.

When partisans communicate incivilly, they are less likely to learn from each other and more likely to distrust each other. This paper analyzes the way that people learn about norms of political behavior online. I conduct an experiment that tests how different forms of moral suasion—appeals to morality intended to influence behavior—affect how Democrats and Republicans learn about norms of partisan speech. Using bots that shared the political identity of the subjects, I sent messages that appealed to the moral principle theorized to be most convincing to either liberals (“care”) or to conservatives (“authority”). Using a sample of subjects who had been frequently incivil in political discussions on Twitter during the 2016 US presidential election, I found that both forms of moral suasion were equally effective at dissuading both Democrats and Republicans from online incivility. These effects were significantly moderated by the anonymity of the subjects, especially among Republicans: subjects who elected to have an anonymous profile were much less likely to change their behavior. On some subsamples, the reduction in incivility persisted for up to a month after\ntreatment.","author":[{"family":"Munger","given":"Kevin M."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,7]]},"language":"en","page":"37","source":"Semantic Scholar","title":"Experimentally Reducing Partisan Incivility on Twitter","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/608a/a69f210b4d91baf16080272ea411d6b9fb76.pdf"},

However, the privacy-related design choices described here are some of the many possible ways to illustrate the extent to which changes in network architecture are, indeed, changes in network governance.","author":[{"family":"Musiani","given":"Francesca"}],"issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","page":"9","source":"Zotero","title":"Decentralised internet governance: the case of a ‘peer-to-peer cloud’","type":"article-journal","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"musianiNetworkArchitectureInternet2013","abstract":"The architecture of a networked system is its underlying technical and logical structure, including transmission equipment, communication protocols, infrastructure, and connectivity between its components or nodes. This article introduces the idea of network architecture as internet governance, and more specifically, it outlines the dialectic between centralised and distributed architectures, institutions and practices, and how they mutually affect each other. The article argues that network architecture is internet governance in the sense that, by changing the design of the networks subtending internet-based services and the global internet itself, its politics are affected – the balance of rights between users and providers, the capacity of online communities to engage in open and direct interaction, the fair competition between actors of the internet market.","author":[{"family":"Musiani","given":"Francesca"}],"issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"en","page":"9","source":"Zotero","title":"Network architecture as internet governance","type":"article-journal","volume":"2"},

First, after controlling for extensive criminological, demographic, and socioeconomic variables, I found that blacks, males, and offenders with low levels of education and income receive substantially longer sentences. Second, disparities are primarily generated by departures from the guidelines, rather than differential sentencing within the guidelines. Departures produce about 55 percent of the black?white difference and 70 percent of the male?female difference. Third, although black?white disparities occur across offenses, the largest differences are for drug trafficking. The Hispanic?white disparity is generated primarily by those convicted of drug trafficking and firearm possession/trafficking. Last, blacks and males are also less likely to get no prison term when that option is available; less likely to receive downward departures; and more likely to receive upward adjustments and, conditioned on having a downward departure, receive smaller reductions than whites and females.","author":[{"family":"Mustard","given":"David B."}],"container-title":"The Journal of Law and Economics","container-title-short":"The Journal of Law and Economics","DOI":"10.1086/320276","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2001]]},"page":"285-314","title":"Racial, Ethnic, and Gender Disparities in Sentencing: Evidence from the U.S. Federal Courts","title-short":"Racial, Ethnic, and Gender Disparities in Sentencing: Evidence from the U.S. Federal Courts","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/320276","volume":"44"},

  {"id":"mutzInYourFacePoliticsConsequences2015","abstract":"Americans are disgusted with watching politicians screaming and yelling at one another on television. But does all the noise really make a difference? Drawing on numerous studies, Diana Mutz provides the first comprehensive look at the consequences of in-your-face politics. Her book contradicts the conventional wisdom by documenting both the benefits and the drawbacks of in-your-face media.\"In-your-face\" politics refers to both the level of incivility and the up-close and personal way that we experience political conflict on television. Just as actual physical closeness intensifies people's emotional reactions to others, the appearance of closeness on a video screen has similar effects. We tend to keep our distance from those with whom we disagree. Modern media, however, puts those we dislike in our faces in a way that intensifies our negative reactions. Mutz finds that incivility is particularly detrimental to facilitating respect for oppositional political viewpoints and to citizens' levels of trust in politicians and the political process. On the positive side, incivility and close-up camera perspectives contribute to making politics more physiologically arousing and entertaining to viewers. This encourages more attention to political programs, stimulates recall of the content, and encourages people to relay content to others.In the end, In-Your-Face Politics demonstrates why political incivility is not easily dismissed as a disservice to democracy—it may even be a necessity in an age with so much competition for citizens' attention.","author":[{"family":"Mutz","given":"Diana C."}],"ISBN":"978-1-4008-6587-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,3,22]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"285","publisher":"Princeton University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"In-Your-Face Politics: The Consequences of Uncivil Media","title-short":"In-Your-Face Politics","type":"book"},

On the other side, a culture of struggle sessions and virtue signalling lurks behind a therapeutic language of trigger warnings and safe spaces. The feminist side of the online culture wars has its equally geeky subcultures right through to its mainstream expression.

Informed by a perspective of complex adaptive systems, this study theorizes how the user-to-application CNE is temporally different from the application-to-user CNE, and how these CNEs may be influenced by the governance mechanisms of the platform. We empirically test our theoretical arguments using a longitudinal data about a leading software browser. Our first main finding is the temporal asymmetry between the user-to-application CNE and the application-to-user CNE. Specifically, while the increased installed base of end users has a primarily long-term impact on the growth of application number and variety, the increased number and variety of applications have primarily short-term impacts on the growth of end users. Our second finding is that the length of application review time weakens the long-term user-to-application effect, but not the short-term application-to-user effect. Third, we also find that frequent platform updating can significantly weaken both the long-term user-to-application CNE and the short-term application-to-user CNE. Our study generates important theoretical and practical implications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,18]]},"author":[{"literal":"Nanjing University"},{"family":"Song","given":"Peijian"},{"family":"Xue","given":"Ling"},{"literal":"Georgia State University"},{"family":"Rai","given":"Arun"},{"literal":"Georgia State University"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Cheng"},{"literal":"Fudan University"}],"container-title":"MIS Quarterly","DOI":"10.25300/MISQ/2018/13737","ISSN":"02767783, 21629730","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"121-142","source":"Crossref","title":"The Ecosystem of Software Platform: A Study of Asymmetric Cross-Side Network Effects and Platform Governance","title-short":"The Ecosystem of Software Platform","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://misq.org/the-ecosystem-of-software-platform-a-study-of-asymmetric-cross-side-network-effects-and-platform-governance.html","volume":"42"},
  {"id":"napierAccountingHistoryAccounting2001","abstract":"The “new” accounting historians that emerged from the mid-1980s characterised their predecessors as relying heavily on a view of accounting as progressive and accounting change as evolutionary. From a social science perspective, progress is a problematic concept, as it implies not just change but also improvement, and thus seems to imply the making of a value judgement. As accounting has become an object of study less as a technical and more as a social phenomenon, consensus as to what constitutes an improvement becomes harder to secure. However, from a perspective grounded in historiography, this paper reviews the use of a concept of progress in the writing of history from the eighteenth century, and analyses its use, together with that of a concept of evolution, in “traditional” accounting history. Appealing to recent developments in the understanding of the role of narrative in history, the paper suggests that the use of narratives of accounting progress should not be ruled out on a priori grounds.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Napier","given":"Christopher J."}],"container-title":"Accounting History","DOI":"10.1177/103237320100600202","ISSN":"1032-3732, 1749-3374","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2001,11]]},"language":"en","page":"7-31","source":"Crossref","title":"Accounting history and accounting progress","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/103237320100600202","volume":"6"},

Despite taking on many of journalism’s traditional roles, Facebook and other platforms, such as Twitter and Google, have presented themselves as tech companies—and therefore not subject to the same regulations and ethical codes as conventional media organizations. Challenging such superficial distinctions, Philip M. Napoli offers a timely and persuasive case for understanding and governing social media as news media, with a fundamental obligation to serve the public interest.Social Media and the Public Interest explores how and why social media platforms became so central to news consumption and distribution as they met many of the challenges of finding information—and audiences—online. Napoli illustrates the implications of a system in which coders and engineers drive out journalists and editors as the gatekeepers who determine media content. He argues that a social media–driven news ecosystem represents a case of market failure in what he calls the algorithmic marketplace of ideas. To respond, we need to rethink fundamental elements of media governance based on a revitalized concept of the public interest. A compelling examination of the intersection of social media and journalism, Social Media and the Public Interest offers valuable insights for the democratic governance of today’s most influential shapers of news.","author":[{"family":"Napoli","given":"Philip M."}],"ISBN":"978-0-231-54554-9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,27]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"472","publisher":"Columbia University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Social Media and the Public Interest: Media Regulation in the Disinformation Age","title-short":"Social Media and the Public Interest","type":"book"},

In philosophical debates, however, we find widely divergent accounts of that concept, ranging from views based on a conception of human needs to religious approaches trying to explain the ‘inviolability’ of the person. The view presented here reconstructs the basic claim of human dignity historically and normatively as resting on the moral status of the person as a reasongiving, reason-demanding and reason-deserving being. The person as holding a basic moral right to justification is the true ground for the claim of having one’s dignity respected: as someone who must not be subjected to norms, rules, or institutions which cannot be properly justified to that person in appropriate practices of justification. To possess human dignity means being an equal member in the realm of subjects and authorities of justification and to be respected as such. This is the moral ground of social criticism, implied in particular social and political demands raised in given historical contexts. Thus, critical theory has to be reoriented towards a critique of the relations of justification in a given social order of justification.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,25]]},"DOI":"10.4324/9781315468297","edition":"1","editor":[{"family":"Nascimento","given":"Amos"},{"family":"Lutz-Bachmann","given":"Matthias"}],"event-place":"Abingdon, Oxon ; New York, NY : Routledge, 2018. | Series: Rethinking political and international theory","ISBN":"978-1-315-46829-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,4]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Routledge","publisher-place":"Abingdon, Oxon ; New York, NY : Routledge, 2018. | Series: Rethinking political and international theory","source":"Crossref","title":"Human Dignity: Perspectives from a Critical Theory of Human Rights","title-short":"Human Dignity","type":"book","URL":"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781315468280"},

  {"id":"nasstromLegitimacyPeople2007","abstract":"In political theory it goes without saying that the constitution of government raises a claim for legitimacy. With the constitution of the people, however, it is different. It is often dismissed as a historical question. The conviction is that since the people cannot decide on its own composition the boundaries of democracy must be determined by other factors, such as the contingent forces of history.

The failure to see this is what makes many theorists run into the arms of history.

  {"id":"nathansDictatorshipReasonAleksandr2007","abstract":"The Soviet mathematical logician Aleksandr Vol'pin is often credited with introducing the post-Stalin dissident strategy of attempting to hold the Soviet government to its own laws. In this article, Benjamin Nathans asks how Vol'pin himself arrived at the deceptively familiar rhetoric of civil rights and rule of law and how that rhetoric functioned in emerging dissident circles in the 1960s. Rather than approaching rights through classic liberal notions of social contract and self-interest, Vol'pin drew on the strikingly cosmopolitan and interdisciplinary ferment of Soviet intellectual life during the thaw years, putting logic, philosophy of language, and the burgeoning field of cybernetics to unexpected purposes. The result, Nathans suggests, was a counterintuitive blend of idealism and literalism that became an indispensable element of dissident thought and practice within late Soviet culture.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Nathans","given":"Benjamin"}],"container-title":"Slavic Review","DOI":"10.2307/20060376","ISSN":"0037-6779, 2325-7784","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"language":"en","page":"630-663","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"The Dictatorship of Reason: Aleksandr Vol 'pin and the Idea of Rights under “Developed Socialism”","title-short":"The Dictatorship of Reason","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/slavic-review/article/dictatorship-of-reason-aleksandr-vol-pin-and-the-idea-of-rights-under-developed-socialism/74F220E4BB19DACA6193967CFFEB36B1","volume":"66"},

It is common ground among many, if not all, approaches to ethics that vulnerability requires us to respond ethically. Here, I argue that human dignity is distinctive among ethical values in that it values us because of, rather than in spite of, or regardless of, our universal vulnerability. The term “dignity” is used synonymously with “human dignity” here, since an investigation of the dignity of non-human entities forms no part of the present examination.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Neal","given":"Mary"}],"container-title":"Liverpool Law Review","DOI":"10.1007/s10991-012-9124-6","ISSN":"0144-932X, 1572-8625","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,11]]},"language":"en","page":"177-200","source":"Crossref","title":"“Not Gods But Animals”: Human Dignity and Vulnerable Subjecthood","title-short":"“Not Gods But Animals”","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10991-012-9124-6","volume":"33"},
  {"id":"nealRespectHumanDignity2014","abstract":"The idea of ‘human dignity’ is, notoriously, as ambiguous as it is compelling. Notwithstanding the absence of any clear or settled definition of human dignity, either in the abstract or in terms of what it means in practice, it is an idea which takes pride of place in international legal documents, in judicial reasoning, and in scholarship across a range of disciplines, where it seems, particularly in recent years, to have become the focus for an explosion of academic interest and an accompanying proliferation of literature. Much of the existing literature attempts to uncover the meaning, or multiple meanings, of ‘human dignity’, focusing on the uncertainty surrounding the substance or content of the idea and trying to compose a catalogue of use-types. In this article, my primary aim will be to address another type of uncertainty, namely uncertainty about the role, function, or status within legal frameworks of the ‘dignity norm’ – the norm requiring respect for human dignity. I want to explore several possibilities: first, that the dignity norm is simply a proxy for respect for autonomy; second, that it is a right in the sense that we can speak of a specific ‘right to have dignity respected’; and third, that it is a legal principle. Having problematised each of these in turn, I will contend that the function of the dignity norm is best captured by describing it as the ‘substantive basic norm’ of the legal systems wherein it appears.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Neal","given":"Mary"}],"container-title":"International Journal of Law in Context","DOI":"10.1017/S1744552313000359","ISSN":"1744-5523, 1744-5531","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,3]]},"language":"en","page":"26-46","source":"Crossref","title":"Respect for human dignity as ‘substantive basic norm’","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S1744552313000359/type/journal_article","volume":"10"},

Yet, partisan selective exposure research tends to stem from experimental or self-reported data, which limits the applicability of their findings in a high-choice media environment. We explore observed online audience behavior data to present a portrait of the actual online political news audience. We find that this audience frequently navigates to news sites from Facebook, and that it congregates among a few popular, well-known political news sites. We also find that political news sites comprise ideologically diverse audiences, and that they share audiences with nearly all smaller, more ideologically extreme outlets.

This report offers a comprehensive overview of the relationship between technology, democracy and the polarisation of public discourse. Technology is inherently political, and the ways in which it is designed and used have ongoing implications for participation, deliberation and democracy. Algorithms, automation, big data analytics and artificial intelligence are becoming increasingly embedded in everyday life in democratic societies; this report provides an in-depth analysis of the technological affordances that enhance and undermine political decision-making, both now and in the future.

But increasingly, social media has emerged as a fertile soil for deliberately produced misinformation campaigns, conspiracy, and extremist alternative media. How does the sourcing of political news and information define contemporary political communication in different countries in Europe? To understand what users are sharing in their political communication, we analyzed large volumes of political conversation over a major social media platform—in real-time and native languages during campaign periods—for three major European elections. Rather than chasing a definition of what has come to be known as “fake news,” we produce a grounded typology of what users actually shared and apply rigorous coding and content analysis to define the types of sources, compare them in context with known forms of political news and information, and contrast their circulation patterns in France, the United Kingdom, and Germany. Based on this analysis, we offer a definition of “junk news” that refers to deliberately produced misleading, deceptive, and incorrect propaganda purporting to be real news. In the first multilingual, cross-national comparison of junk news sourcing and consumption over social media, we analyze over 4 million tweets from three elections and find that (1) users across Europe shared substantial amounts of junk news in varying qualities and quantities, (2) amplifier accounts drive low to medium levels of traffic and news sharing, and (3) Europeans still share large amounts of professionally produced information from media outlets, but other traditional sources of political information including political parties and government agencies are in decline.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Neudert","given":"Lisa-Maria"},{"family":"Howard","given":"Philip"},{"family":"Kollanyi","given":"Bence"}],"container-title":"Social Media + Society","DOI":"10.1177/2056305119863147","ISSN":"2056-3051, 2056-3051","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,7]]},"language":"en","page":"205630511986314","source":"Crossref","title":"Sourcing and Automation of Political News and Information During Three European Elections","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2056305119863147","volume":"5"},

This paper explores the relationship between liberty and security implicated by government surveillance and citizen-initiated efforts to cast the gaze back at the government (so-called “reciprocal surveillance”). In particular, this paper explores how a neorepublican conception of political liberty, deﬁned as the absence of the possibility of domination, can inform future information policy research in this area. The paper concludes that, to be fully non-dominating, government must respect and provide effective institutional and legal mechanisms for their citizenry to effectuate selfgovernment and command noninterference. Establishing liberal access rights to information about government conduct and mechanisms that ensure that citizens can effectively command noninterference are justiﬁed on the grounds that they reduce the possibility of arbitrary, and actual, interference with the right of the people govern themselves.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Newell","given":"Bryce Clayton"}],"container-title":"Government Information Quarterly","DOI":"10.1016/j.giq.2014.04.001","ISSN":"0740624X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,7]]},"language":"en","page":"421-431","source":"Crossref","title":"Technopolicing, surveillance, and citizen oversight: A neorepublican theory of liberty and information control","title-short":"Technopolicing, surveillance, and citizen oversight","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0740624X14000835","volume":"31"},

  {"id":"ngConflictManagementSelfmanaged2015","abstract":"Over the last two decades, various management theorists have shifted their research attention from top-down authority organizations to self-managed organizations that run in the absence of hierarchies. At the same time, the importance of conflict management is increasingly acknowledged in literature, with research direction moving towards the analysis of conflict management strategies at group/team level. Combining these research interests and directions, the author executed a research on Conflict management in Self-managed team, by studying the case of Wikipedia - a phenomenal online success for a self-managed collaborative organization. This study takes into account, besides the self-management structure, the attributes of Wikipedia as a virtual team with cultural diversity. The purpose of this research is twofold. First, it identifies the components that make up Wikipedia‟s conflict resolution process and observes how these components interact to form an effective conflict resolution system. Second, this research analyses the norms and regulations with regards to managing conflicts on Wikipedia and identifies the conflict management style at the group level. Two findings of the research: (1) Wikipedia conflict resolution system meets the criteria for a complementary system, in which components interact and address the limitations of one another, (2) The principal conflict management style of Wikipedia is an integrative style built on individual‟s collaborating and compromising conflict-handling behaviour, exhibited by a wide range of functional conflict resolution strategies. This research reveals the impact of organizational culture, reflected in community norms, on knowledge management in Wikipedia and highlights the effectiveness of its conflict management approach, reinforcing Wikipedia‟s role as an exemplary model of an extreme self-managed team.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Ng","given":"Binh"}],"DOI":"10.13140/RG.2.2.10022.16969","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Unpublished","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Conflict Management in Self-managed team: the case of Wikipedia","title-short":"Conflict Management in Self-managed team","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://rgdoi.net/10.13140/RG.2.2.10022.16969"},

  {"id":"niculescuStrategicIntellectualProperty2018","abstract":"In this paper, we explore the strategic decision of an incumbent to open a proprietary technology platform to allow same-side co-opetition in a market characterized by network effects. We propose a game-theoretic model that analytically conceptualizes the interplay among the degree of same-side platform openness, the absorptive capacity of the entrant, and the intensity of network effects. Our analysis uncovers interesting new results. First, when entrant product quality is exogenous, under very strong network effects, the incumbent closes the technology. Moreover, we discuss various interesting open-platform co-opetition outcomes that arise under a fully covered market. When the entrant chooses the quality level and the incumbent is strategic in its platform opening decision, we find that intense network effects make new players shun the market, so intellectual property (IP) sharing is not possible in equilibrium. When the network effects are of intermediate intensity, the incumbent opens the technology to the entrants who have a sufficiently high absorptive capacity, calibrating the amount of sharing to the entrant’s absorptive capacity level to ensure that the duopoly setting is mutually beneficial. Our key findings and insights are robust to several model extensions, including scenarios when the incumbent is uncertain of the entrant’s absorptive capacity, or when the entrant incurs a general non-linear development cost structure. We also compare and contrast bounded versus unbounded market scenarios. We further explore the ability of the incumbent to engineer the strength of network effects in the market and uncover non-trivial alternating-monotonicity patterns for the optimal intensity of network effects with respect to the entrant’s absorptive capacity. We also show that a model with exogenous network effects could drastically underestimate the range of entrants’ absorptive capacity values for which the incumbent should open its platform, causing the latter to miss valuable co-opetition opportunities. We also discuss various managerial implications of our theoretical framework.The online appendix is available at https://doi-org.proxy.lib.uiowa.edu/10.1287/isre.2017.0756.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Niculescu","given":"Marius F."},{"family":"Wu","given":"D.

  {"id":"nordstromAccessJusticeWorld2008","abstract":"The current dispute settlement system of the World Trade Organization (WTO) creates a particular challenge for WTO Members with limited exports since litigation costs are more or less independent of the commercial stakes involved in a dispute. Small Members with small trade stakes may therefore find it too costly to pursue legitimate claims. Reviewing the aims and practices of small claims procedures at the national and supranational level, we analyse whether a similar institution could be introduced at the WTO. While a strong empirical case can be made for such an innovation, the legal and political challenges should not be underestimated. Indeed, can we define a “small claim” in a context where government policies are being disputed? Many observers may respond negatively so that we have to think creatively if such an institution can be adapted to the WTO context. As an initial step, we make a prima facie case that the current dispute settlement system effectively discriminates against small claims and hence owners of small claims, and thus, in particular, against least developed countries, small island economies and low income developing countries. This empirical task is carried out in Part 2. In Part 3 we explain what small claims procedures are at the national level, what purpose they serve, how they are organised in different jurisdictions involving alternative design features, and what challenges they have faced. We also discuss the recent creation in the EU of a transnational European Small Claims Procedure, a new initiative at the supranational level in this area, as well as the distinct handling of small claims by the Iran-US Claims Tribunal and the United Nations Compensation Commission.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Nordström","given":"Håkan"},{"family":"Shaffer","given":"Gregory"}],"container-title":"World Trade Review","DOI":"10.1017/S1474745608003996","ISSN":"1474-7456, 1475-3138","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,10]]},"language":"en","page":"587-640","source":"Crossref","title":"Access to justice in the World Trade Organization: a case for a small claims procedure?","title-short":"Access to justice in the World Trade Organization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S1474745608003996/type/journal_article","volume":"7"},

Participants then completed an evaluation of the course and instructor. It was hypothesized that students scoring above the manipulated mean would rate the course and instructor more highly than students scoring below the manipulated mean. It was further hypothesized that students who were told that the class mean was higher would rate the course and instructor more highly than students who were told that the mean was lower. Results supported the first hypothesis. However, hypothesis two was not supported. Students receiving the lower manipulated class mean rated instructors more favorably.

  {"id":"nwPublicPoliticalSystem2018","abstract":"Survey Report\nAt a time of growing stress on democracy around the world, Americans generally agree on democratic ideals and values that are important for the United States. But for the most part, they see the country falling well short in living up to these ideals, according to a new study of opinion on the strengths and weaknesses of key aspects of American democracy and the political system.\n\nThe public’s criticisms of the political system run the gamut, from a failure to hold elected officials accountable to a lack of transparency in government. And just a third say the phrase “people agree on basic facts even if they disagree politically” describes this country well today.\n\nThe perceived shortcomings encompass some of the core elements of American democracy. An overwhelming share of the public (84%) says it is very important that “the rights and freedoms of all people are respected.” Yet just 47% say this describes the country very or somewhat well; slightly more (53%) say it does not.\n\nDespite these criticisms, most Americans say democracy is working well in the United States – though relatively few say it is working very well. At the same time, there is broad support for making sweeping changes to the political system: 61% say “significant changes” are needed in the fundamental “design and structure” of American government to make it work for current times.\n\nThe public sends mixed signals about how the American political system should be changed, and no proposals attract bipartisan support. Yet in views of how many of the specific aspects of the political system are working, both Republicans and Democrats express dissatisfaction.\n\nTo be sure, there are some positives. A sizable majority of Americans (74%) say the military leadership in the U.S. does not publicly support one party over another, and nearly as many (73%) say the phrase “people are free to peacefully protest” describes this country very or somewhat well.\n\nIn general, however, there is a striking mismatch between the public’s goals for American democracy and its views of whether they are being fulfilled. On 23 specific measures assessing democracy, the political system and elections in the United States – each widely regarded by the public as very important – there are only eight on which majorities say the country is doing even somewhat well.\n\nThe new survey of the public’s views of democracy and the political system by Pew Research Center was conducted online Jan. 29-Feb. 13 among 4,656 adults. It was supplemented by a survey conducted March 7-14 among 1,466 adults on landlines and cellphones.\n\nAmong the major findings:\n\nMixed views of structural changes in the political system. The surveys examine several possible changes to representative democracy in the United States. Most Americans reject the idea of amending the Constitution to give states with larger populations more seats in the U.S. Senate, and there is little support for expanding the size of the House of Representatives. As in the past, however, a majority (55%) supports changing the way presidents are elected so that the candidate who receives the most total votes nationwide – rather than a majority in the Electoral College – wins the presidency.\n\nA majority says Trump lacks respect for democratic institutions. Fewer than half of Americans (45%) say Donald Trump has a great deal or fair amount of respect for the country’s democratic institutions and traditions, while 54% say he has not too much respect or no respect. These views are deeply split along partisan and ideological lines. Most conservative Republicans (55%) say Trump has a “great deal” of respect for democratic institutions; most liberal Democrats (60%) say he has no respect “at all” for these traditions and institutions.\n\nGovernment and politics seen as working better locally than nationally. Far more Americans have a favorable opinion of their local government (67%) than of the federal government (35%). In addition, there is substantial satisfaction with the quality of candidates running for Congress and local elections in recent elections. That stands in contrast with views of the recent presidential candidates; just 41% say the quality of presidential candidates in recent elections has been good.\n\nFew say tone of political debate is ‘respectful.’ Just a quarter of Americans say “the tone of debate among political leaders is respectful” is a statement that describes the country well. However, the public is more divided in general views about tone and discourse: 55% say too many people are “easily offended” over the language others use; 45% say people need to be more careful in using language “to avoid offending” others.\n\nAmericans don’t spare themselves from criticism. In addressing the shortcomings of the political system, Americans do not spare themselves from criticism: Just 39% say “voters are knowledgeable about candidates and issues” describes the country very or somewhat well. In addition, a 56% majority say they have little or no confidence in the political wisdom of the American people. However, that is less negative than in early 2016, when 64% had little or no confidence. Since the presidential election, Republicans have become more confident in people’s political wisdom.\n\nCynicism about money and politics. Most Americans think that those who donate a lot of money to elected officials have more political influence than others. An overwhelming majority (77%) supports limits on the amount of money individuals and organizations can spend on political campaigns and issues. And nearly two-thirds of Americans (65%) say new laws could be effective in reducing the role of money in politics.\n\nVarying views of obligations of good citizenship. Large majorities say it is very important to vote, pay taxes and always follow the law in order to be a good citizen. Half of Americans say it is very important to know the Pledge of Allegiance, while 45% say it is very important to protest government actions a person believes is wrong. Just 36% say displaying the American flag is very important to being a good citizen.\n\nMost are aware of basic facts about political system and democracy. Overwhelming shares correctly identify the constitutional right guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution and know the role of the Electoral College. A narrower majority knows how a tied vote is broken in the Senate, while fewer than half know the number of votes needed to break a Senate filibuster. (Take the civics knowledge quiz.)\nDemocracy seen as working well, but most say ‘significant changes’ are needed\nIn general terms, most Americans think U.S. democracy is working at least somewhat well. Yet a 61% majority says “significant changes” are needed in the fundamental “design and structure” of American government to make it work in current times. When asked to compare the U.S. political system with those of other developed nations, fewer than half rate it “above average” or “best in the world.”\n\nOverall, nearly six-in-ten Americans (58%) say democracy in the United States is working very or somewhat well, though just 18% say it is working very well. Four-in-ten say it is working not too well or not at all well.\n\nRepublicans have more positive views of the way democracy is working than do Democrats: 72% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say democracy in the U.S. is working at least somewhat well, though only 30% say it is working very well. Among Democrats and Democratic leaners, 48% say democracy works at least somewhat well, with just 7% saying it is working very well.\n\nMore Democrats than Republicans say significant changes are needed in the design and structure of government. By more than two-to-one (68% to 31%), Democrats say significant changes are needed. Republicans are evenly divided: 50% say significant changes are needed in the structure of government, while 49% say the current structure serves the country well and does not need significant changes.\n\nThe public has mixed evaluations of the nation’s political system compared with those of other developed countries. About four-in-ten say the U.S. political system is the best in the world (15%) or above average (26%); most say it is average (28%) or below average (29%), when compared with other developed nations. Several other national institutions and aspects of life in the U.S. – including the military, standard of living and scientific achievements – are more highly rated than the political system.\n\nRepublicans are about twice as likely as Democrats to say the U.S. political system is best in the world or above average (58% vs. 27%). As recently as four years ago, there were no partisan differences in these opinions.\nBipartisan criticism of political system in a number of areas\nMajorities in both parties say “people are free to peacefully protest” describes the U.S. well. And there is bipartisan sentiment that the military leadership in the U.S. does not publicly favor one party over another.\n\nIn most cases, however, partisans differ on how well the country lives up to democratic ideals – or majorities in both parties say it is falling short.\n\nSome of the most pronounced partisan differences are in views of equal opportunity in the U.S. and whether the rights and freedoms of all people are respected.\n\nRepublicans are twice as likely as Democrats to say “everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed” describes the United States very or somewhat well (74% vs. 37%).\n\nA majority of Republicans (60%) say the rights and freedoms of all people are respected in the United States, compared with just 38% of Democrats.\n\nAnd while only about half of Republicans (49%) say the country does well in respecting “the views of people who are not in the majority on issues,” even fewer Democrats (34%) say this.\n\nNo more than about a third in either party say elected officials who engage in misconduct face serious consequences or that government “conducts its work openly and transparently.” Comparably small shares in both parties (28% of Republicans, 25% of Democrats) say the following sentence describes the country well: “People who give a lot of money to elected officials do not have more political influence than other people.”\n\nFewer than half in both parties also say news organizations do not favor one political party, though Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say this describes the country well (38% vs. 18%). There also is skepticism in both parties about the political independence of judges. Nearly half of Democrats (46%) and 38% of Republicans say judges are not influenced by political parties.\nPartisan gaps in opinions about many aspects of U.S. elections\nFor the most part, Democrats and Republicans agree about the importance of many principles regarding elections in the U.S.\n\nOverwhelming shares in both parties say it is very important that elections are free from tampering (91% of Republicans, 88% of Democrats say this) and that voters are knowledgeable about candidates and issues (78% in both parties).\n\nBut there are some notable differences: Republicans are almost 30 percentage points more likely than Democrats to say it is very important that “no ineligible voters are permitted to vote” (83% of Republicans vs. 55% of Democrats).\n\nAnd while majorities in both parties say high turnout in presidential elections is very important, more Democrats (76%) than Republicans (64%) prioritize high voter turnout.\n\nThe differences are even starker in evaluations of how well the country is doing in fulfilling many of these objectives. Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say that “no eligible voters are prevented from voting” describes elections in the U.S. very or somewhat well (80% vs. 56%). By contrast, more Democrats (76%) than Republicans (42%) say “no ineligible voters are permitted to vote” describes elections well.\n\nDemocrats – particularly politically engaged Democrats – are critical of the process for determining congressional districts. A majority of Republicans (63%) say the way congressional voting districts are determined is fair and reasonable compared with just 39% of Democrats; among Democrats who are highly politically engaged, just 29% say the process is fair.\n\nAnd fewer Democrats than Republicans consider voter turnout for elections in the U.S. – both presidential and local – to be “high.” Nearly three-quarters of Republicans (73%) say “there is high voter turnout in presidential elections” describes elections well, compared with only about half of Democrats (52%).\n\nStill, there are a few points of relative partisan agreement: Majorities in both parties (62% of Republicans, 55% of Democrats) say “elections are free from tampering.” And Republicans and Democrats are about equally skeptical about whether voters are knowledgeable about candidates and issues (40% of Republicans, 38% of Democrats).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,6]]},"author":[{"family":"NW","given":"1615 L.

  {"id":"nyquistArbitraryRuleSlavery2015","abstract":"\"Slavery appears as a figurative construct during the English revolution of the mid-seventeenth century, and again in the American and French revolutions, when radicals represent their treatment as a form of political slavery. What, if anything, does figurative, political slavery have to do with transatlantic slavery? In Arbitrary Rule, Mary Nyquist explores connections between political and chattel slavery by excavating the tradition of Western political thought that justifies actively opposing tyranny. She argues that as powerful rhetorical and conceptual constructs, Greco-Roman political liberty and slavery reemerge at the time of early modern Eurocolonial expansion; they help to create racialized \"free\" national identities and their \"unfree\" counterparts in non-European nations represented as inhabiting an earlier, privative age. Arbitrary Rule is the first book to tackle political slavery's discursive complexity, engaging Eurocolonialism, political philosophy, and literary studies, areas of study too often kept apart. Nyquist proceeds through analyses not only of texts that are canonical in political thought--by Aristotle, Cicero, Hobbes, and Locke--but also of literary works by Euripides, Buchanan, Vondel, Montaigne, and Milton, together with a variety of colonialist and political writings, with special emphasis on tracts written during the English revolution. She illustrates how \"antityranny discourse,\" which originated in democratic Athens, was adopted by republican Rome, and revived in early modern Western Europe, provided members of a \"free\" community with a means of protesting a threatened reduction of privileges or of consolidating a collective, political identity. Its semantic complexity, however, also enabled it to legitimize racialized enslavement and imperial expansion.\"--Publisher's description.","author":[{"family":"Nyquist","given":"Mary"}],"ISBN":"978-0-226-27179-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"language":"English","note":"OCLC: 890757219","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Arbitrary rule: slavery, tyranny, and the power of life and death","title-short":"Arbitrary rule","type":"book"},

  {"id":"obeng-odoomMeaningProspectsFuture2016","abstract":"Elinor Ostrom's work on the commons has convinced mainstream economists that “collective” governance of the commons can overcome the “tragedy of the commons” and “free-rider problems.” Yet, a more systematic appraisal of Ostrom's work shows that it contains no concept of justice. Her idea of rights is extremely limited, often tied to the notion of joint, rather than equal, rights. Indeed, for Ostrom, the notion of the commons is socially separatist and not ecological. Ostrom uses historical examples, but without analyzing how common possession historically evolved and was undermined by external forces. Hence her proposed “collective action” to save the commons actually accelerates the real threats to the commons. A strikingly different and more holistic approach to the commons is offered by Henry George, who posits the commons as the most important path to social, economic, and ecological sustainability. Unlike Ostrom, who studied the commons “scientifically” to show that some goods are neither private, public, nor club-based, George studied the commons to understand and remove injustice at the roots. His approach is more critical and certainly more relevant today in showing that another world is possible. However, George's work too, requires significant changes to update its framing of the meanings, prospects, and future of the commons.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Obeng‐Odoom","given":"Franklin"}],"container-title":"American Journal of Economics and Sociology","DOI":"10.1111/ajes.12144","ISSN":"1536-7150","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","page":"372-414","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The Meaning, Prospects, and Future of the Commons: Revisiting the Legacies of Elinor Ostrom and Henry George","title-short":"The Meaning, Prospects, and Future of the Commons","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajes.12144","volume":"75"},

  {"id":"oberDemocracyDignity2012","abstract":"Dignity, as equal high standing characterized by nonhumiliation and noninfantilization, is democracy's third core value. Along with liberty and equality, it is a necessary condition for collective self-governance. Dignity enables robust exercise of liberty and equality while resisting both neglectful libertarianism and paternalistic egalitarianism. The civic dignity required for democracy is specified through a taxonomy of incompletely and fully moralized forms of dignity. Distinctive features of different regimes of dignity are modeled by simple games and illustrated by historical case studies. Unlike traditional meritocracy and universal human dignity, a civic dignity regime is theoretically stable in a population of self-interested social agents. It is real-world stable because citizens are predictably well motivated to defend those threatened with indignity and because they have resources for effective collective action against threats to dignity. Meritocracy and civic dignity are not inherently liberal, but may persist within a liberal democracy committed to universal human dignity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Ober","given":"Josiah"}],"container-title":"American Political Science Review","DOI":"10.1017/S000305541200038X","ISSN":"0003-0554, 1537-5943","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,11]]},"language":"en","page":"827-846","source":"Crossref","title":"Democracy's Dignity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S000305541200038X/type/journal_article","volume":"106"},
  {"id":"oberDemocracyKnowledge2008","abstract":"When does democracy work well, and why? Is democracy the best form of government? These questions are of supreme importance today as the United States seeks to promote its democratic values abroad. Democracy and Knowledge is the first book to look to ancient Athens to explain how and why directly democratic government by the people produces wealth, power, and security. Combining a history of Athens with contemporary theories of collective action and rational choice developed by economists and political scientists, Josiah Ober examines Athenian democracy's unique contribution to the ancient Greek city-state's remarkable success, and demonstrates the valuable lessons Athenian political practices hold for us today. He argues that the key to Athens's success lay in how the city-state managed and organized the aggregation and distribution of knowledge among its citizens. Ober explores the institutional contexts of democratic knowledge management, including the use of social networks for collecting information, publicity for building common knowledge, and open access for lowering transaction costs. He explains why a government's attempt to dam the flow of information makes democracy stumble. Democratic participation and deliberation consume state resources and social energy. Yet as Ober shows, the benefits of a well-designed democracy far outweigh its costs. Understanding how democracy can lead to prosperity and security is among the most pressing political challenges of modern times. Democracy and Knowledge reveals how ancient Greek politics can help us transcend the democratic dilemmas that confront the world today.","author":[{"family":"Ober","given":"Josiah"}],"collection-title":"Innovation and Learning in Classical Athens","event-place":"Princeton","ISBN":"978-1-4008-2880-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"number-of-pages":"368","publisher":"Princeton University Press","publisher-place":"Princeton","title":"Democracy and Knowledge","title-short":"Democracy and Knowledge","type":"book","URL":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Jge0MlZTKhQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=ober+democratic+knowledge&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api"},

Just as Web 2.0 platforms put publishing in the hands of the masses, without adequate safeguards, computational social science may make surveillance, profiling, and targeting overly accessible.\n\nThe academic study of computational social science explains the field as an interdisciplinary investigation of the social dynamics of society with the aid of advanced computational systems.

In this paper, we discuss the implications of this effect for epistemic communities. We use evolutionary game theoretic methods to show that minority groups can end up disadvantaged in academic interactions like bargaining and collaboration as a result of this effect. These outcomes are more likely, in our models, the smaller the minority group. They occur despite assumptions that majority and minority groups do not differ with respect to skill level, personality, preference, or competence of any sort. Furthermore, as we will argue, these disadvantaged outcomes for minority groups may negatively impact the progress of epistemic communities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,4]]},"author":[{"family":"O’Connor","given":"Cailin"},{"family":"Bruner","given":"Justin"}],"container-title":"Erkenntnis","container-title-short":"Erkenn","DOI":"10.1007/s10670-017-9950-y","ISSN":"1572-8420","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"101-119","source":"Springer Link","title":"Dynamics and Diversity in Epistemic Communities","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10670-017-9950-y","volume":"84"},

Both can be better off if a bandit sets himself up as a dictator--a \"stationary bandit\" who monopolizes and rationalizes theft in the form of taxes. A secure autocrat has an encompassing interest in his domain that leads him to provide a peaceful order and other public goods that increase productivity. Whenever an autocrat expects a brief tenure, it pays him to confiscate those assets whose tax yield over his tenure is less than their total value. This incentive plus the inherent uncertainty of succession in dictatorships imply that autocracies will rarely have good economic performance for more than a generation.

The paradox of the founding prevents a purely democratic constitution from being founded, because the procedures needed to secure its legitimacy cannot be spontaneously self-generated. It displays an infinite regression of procedures presupposing procedures. The paradox of dynamic indeterminacy heads off any attempt to resolve this problem through constitutional amendment. It shows that we cannot evaluate the legitimacy of a dynamically evolving constitution based on projections of its future development. To do so, we would need a stronger basis for making probabilistic judgments about the constitution's future path. After exploring the problems of using constitutional patriotism as such a basis, I outline an alternative built on the ideas of dynamic constitutionalism and reflexive citizenship.

  {"id":"ordoricaPRESIDENTIALPOWERAMERICAN","abstract":"This Note details the legislative history of § 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which empowers the President to unilaterally restrict entry to the United States by any noncitizen. In 2016, President Trump fully embraced this power in implementing a broad travel ban against citizens of eight nations. In order to better understand the historical meaning of § 212(f) and the travel ban, this Note provides context by comparing the social forces at work in 2016, in 1952, and in 1789, when the Quasi-War with France led American legislators to enact the Alien Friends Act. This latter legislation similarly empowered President Adams to unilaterally deport any noncitizen for any reason. During each of these periods, although the United States was not at war, anti-immigrant hysteria gripped many Americans. This comparison reveals that while the Founders were concerned with the tyrannical nature of such unchecked executive power, in 1952 the Congressional majority ignored the Founders’ cautionary approach. This Note concludes by arguing that critics of the travel ban should follow the lead of their predecessors by seeking to amend the law in order to better check the President and return such power to the more democratic legislature.","author":[{"family":"Ordorica","given":"Dan"}],"container-title":"BOSTON UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW","language":"en","page":"34","source":"Zotero","title":"PRESIDENTIAL POWER AND AMERICAN FEAR: A HISTORY OF INA § 212(F)","type":"article-journal","volume":"99"},

He argues that standards for assessing the degree of systemic legitimacy in modern legal systems can develop through reflective exercise of “critical legality,” a concept coined to parallel Hart's “critical morality,” and an expanded understanding of the “external” and “internal” perspectives on legal systems. Following Habermas, he argues that modern positive law must retain systemic legitimacy. After suggesting criteria for measuring systemic legitimacy, the author concludes that the concept provides a useful approach to contemporary problems of “lawless” regimes and “law's imperialism.”","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Orts","given":"Eric W."}],"container-title":"Ratio Juris","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-9337.1993.tb00151.x","ISSN":"1467-9337","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[1993,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"245-278","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Positive Law and Systemic Legitimacy: A Comment on Hart and Habermas*","title-short":"Positive Law and Systemic Legitimacy","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9337.1993.tb00151.x","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"osburgMakingBusinessPersonal2018","abstract":"This essay examines the unintended consequences of governance and economic reform efforts in post-Mao China through ethnographic examination of state audits, market reforms, and the recent anti-corruption campaign. I trace the evolution of elite networks composed of businesspeople and state officials that emerged from China’s economic reforms, and I argue that these networks constitute the social basis of “corruption” in post-Mao China. For the first few decades of the reform period (1978–present), these networks were forged through gendered forms of entertaining and gift exchange. However, as the first generation of post-Mao nouveau riche has given rise to the second generation, this once rather permeable field of alliance building is becoming increasingly closed to the non-elite. By examining the formation and ethos of these networks, I demonstrate how logics of quantification and commensurability associated with capitalism often render particularistic ties rooted in kinship, affect, and pleasure all the more powerful and important to elite actors. My analysis serves to illustrate, more broadly, how systems designed with the purported aim of fostering accountability, efficiency, or fair competition can generate the opposite effects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Osburg","given":"John"}],"container-title":"Current Anthropology","container-title-short":"Current Anthropology","DOI":"10.1086/695831","ISSN":"0011-3204","issue":"S18","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,4,1]]},"page":"S149-S159","source":"www-journals-uchicago-edu.proxy.lib.uiowa.edu (Atypon)","title":"Making Business Personal: Corruption, Anti-corruption, and Elite Networks in Post-Mao China","title-short":"Making Business Personal","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/695831","volume":"59"},

  {"id":"ostromHowTypesGoods2003","abstract":"The study of collective action has matured dramatically since Mancur Olson challenged scholars by positing a general theory in his pathbreaking book on The Logic of Collective Action (1965). Olson's theoretical predictions related to the incapacity of individuals, except under limited conditions, to solve on their own what are now known as `collective action problems'. Olson argued that one characteristic of goods ± that of exclusion ± de®ned all public goods. In contemporary analysis, the problem of achieving exclusion of noncontributors has come instead to characterize all types of collective action problems. Multiple subtypes of collective action problems have been identi®ed. One major class of collective action problems are referred to in contemporary literature as public goods. Another class are referred to as common-pool resources. Common-pool resources are characterized by dif®culty of exclusion and subtractability of resource units and are threatened by overuse leading to congestion or even destruction of the resource. Such threats do not apply to public goods. Diverse production and allocation functions generate further important differences in behavior and outcomes. Scholars have also begun to recognize multiple types of property right bundles that distinguish among authorized entrants, users and claimants, proprietors and full owners. Empirical studies show that groups of individuals who possess at least the rights of proprietorship are able to govern and manage their systems more effectively than presumed in the earlier theoretical literature. The article ends with an analysis of the factors that may be conducive to the organization of a common-property regime as contrasted to a private-property regime.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Ostrom","given":"Elinor"}],"container-title":"Journal of Theoretical Politics","DOI":"10.1177/0951692803015003002","ISSN":"0951-6298, 1460-3667","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,7]]},"language":"en","page":"239-270","source":"Crossref","title":"How Types of Goods and Property Rights Jointly Affect Collective Action","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0951692803015003002","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"otuyeluDeathBlackMales2016","abstract":"This conceptual article critically examines the relationship between cultural competence, oppressive practices, and micro-aggression within the field of social work and the larger community. The Council on Social Work Education requires that topics of race, power, privilege, and cultural competence be included in the graduate schools of social work it endorses. However, the impact of race, culture, class, and privilege in society and the work environment in the form of micro-aggression remains ignored within the human service field. African American males are most often the beneficiaries of services that social workers offer. In addition, they are often the recipient of these embedded messages, which are often witnessed in the form of police brutality, aggressive policing practices, and disproportionate arrest rates. This article presents some of the barriers social workers must be familiar with when addressing micro-aggression, cultural competence, and the impact of micro-aggression on oppression. Finally, recommendations for addressing micro-aggressions within the workplace and the field of social work are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Otuyelu","given":"Folusho"},{"family":"Graham","given":"Warren"},{"family":"Kennedy","given":"Shakira A."}],"container-title":"Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment","DOI":"10.1080/10911359.2016.1139994","ISSN":"1091-1359","issue":"3-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,5,18]]},"page":"430-436","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The death of Black males: The unmasking of cultural competence and oppressive practices in a micro-aggressive environment","title-short":"The death of Black males","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10911359.2016.1139994","volume":"26"},

In the framework of attention economy, attention has been discussed as a valuable commodity whereas distraction, involving both pleasurable entertainment and dissatisfactory disorientation, has been associated with cognitive overload and the erosive lack of focus. By discussing clickbait sites and Facebook in particular, this paper inquires after the value of distractions in and for social media. Understanding distraction, like attention, as both affective and cognitive, this article explores its role in the affective capitalism of clicks, likes, and shares. Rather than conceptualizing attention and distraction as mutually opposing, I argue for conceptualizing them as the two sides of the same coin, namely as rhythmic patterns in the affective fabric particular to the contemporary landscape of ubiquitous networked connectivity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Paasonen","given":"Susanna"}],"container-title":"First Monday","DOI":"10.5210/fm.v21i10.6949","ISSN":"13960466","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,10]]},"language":"en","source":"journals.uic.edu","title":"Fickle focus: Distraction, affect and the production of value in social media","title-short":"Fickle focus","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/6949","volume":"21"},

To deduce the definition of Islam merely on the basis of the primary and secondary textual sources rather than the application of them as Muslim praxis would be an incomplete hermeneutic process in understanding it. We can see that the state and the religious society, which was represented by ulama, were separated from each other in an early stage of Islamic history. The members of ulama were in charge of the intellectual and social life, the law and its application. The values of the modern democracy such as law and order, separation of state authority from the public sphere, observing the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals such as women and religious minorities as the inseparables of democracy were upgraded in Muslim societies. This structure of Muslim society, however, was spoiled by colonialist interventions and the adoption of the modern nation-state concept.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,10,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Paçacı","given":"Mehmet"}],"container-title":"Philosophy & Social Criticism","DOI":"10.1177/0191453713478379","editor":[{"family":"Ferrara","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Kaul","given":"Volker"},{"family":"Rasmussen","given":"David"}],"ISSN":"0191-4537, 1461-734X","issue":"4-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,5]]},"language":"en","page":"361-371","source":"Crossref","title":"Democratic values and the Qur’an as a source of Islam","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0191453713478379","volume":"39"},

This paper examines SNCC's and the NAACP's activities concerning the Economic Opportunity Act during the early and mid-1960s. First, I establish the level of attention SNCC and NAACP devoted to the War on Poverty. Based on analysis of the groups' archives, I find that both groups increased their attention to antipoverty policy during a period when other issues were salient to all African Americans. Second, I assess why these shifts in organizational priorities occurred. My findings indicate that competition among civil rights organizations drove the NAACP and SNCC to commit attention to antipoverty issues, and to focus attention on grassroots organizing concerning the War on Poverty.

  {"id":"pagalloAlgoRhythmsBeatLegal2018","abstract":"The paper focuses on concerns and legal challenges brought on by the use of algorithms. A particular class of algorithms that augment or replace analysis and decisionmaking by humans, i.e. data analytics and machine learning, is under scrutiny. Taking into account Balkin’s work on Bthe laws of an algorithmic society^, attention is drawn to obligations of transparency, matters of due process, and accountability. This US-centric analysis on drawbacks and loopholes of current legal systems is complemented with the analysis of norms and principles of the EU data protection law, or BGDPR^. The aim is twofold. On the one hand, the intent is to shed light on some crucial differences between the US and EU law on the regulation of algorithmic operators, both public and private. Whereas, in the USA, scholars debate whether and to what extent new duties and responsibilities of algorithmic operators, e.g. information fiduciaries, have to amend the current framework of self-regulation and light government—as shown by the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy report from November 2016—in EU law much of the new duties and responsibilities of algorithmic operators have been passed upon them as data controllers. Whether such approaches will successfully tackle the normative challenges of the algorithmic society is, on the other hand, an open issue that will likely represent the main topic of debate over the next years. Disagreement may concern: (i) the terms framing the legal question in e.g. statistical purposes of the data processing; (ii) how such terms are related to each other in legal reasoning (e.g. a right to explanation as valid law in the EU); and (iii) legal hard cases that will increasingly have to do with the principles that are at stake also but not only in data protection (e.g. informational self-determination). By entrusting such legal hard cases to algorithms, or some sort of smart artificial agent, humans still bear full responsibility for the judgment of what is socially, ethically, and legally Bplain^ and Bhard^ in social affairs. The balance between delegation of decisions to algorithms and nondelegation will be the leitmotiv of the algorithmic society. Since the devil is in the detail, the current paper is devoted to some of them.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Pagallo","given":"Ugo"}],"container-title":"Philosophy & Technology","DOI":"10.1007/s13347-017-0277-z","ISSN":"2210-5433, 2210-5441","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,12]]},"language":"en","page":"507-524","source":"Crossref","title":"Algo-Rhythms and the Beat of the Legal Drum","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13347-017-0277-z","volume":"31"},

  {"id":"paglieriPleaEcologicalArgument2017","abstract":"In spite of significant research efforts, argument technologies do not seem poised to scale up as much as most commentators would hope or even predict. In this paper, I discuss what obstacles bar the way to more widespread success of argument technologies and venture some suggestions on how to circumvent such difficulties: doing so will require a significant shift in how this research area is typically understood and practiced. I begin by exploring a much broader yet closely related question: To what extent are people natively good at arguing? This issue has always been central to philosophical reflection and it has become even more urgent nowadays, with the explosion of persuasive technologies and unprecedented opportunities for large-scale social influence. The answer hinges on what aspect of argumentation is taken under consideration: evidence suggests that people are relatively bad at analyzing the structure of arguments, especially when these are presented out of context and in abstract terms; in contrast, data show that even laymen tend to excel in the interactive practice of argumentation, in particular when motivation is high and something significant is at stake. Unfortunately, current argument technologies are more closely tailored to the former type of activity than to the latter, which is the main reason behind their relative lack of success with the general public. Changing this state of affair will require a commitment to ecological argument technologies: that is, technologies designed to support real-time, engaging and meaningful argumentative interactions performed by laypeople in their ordinary life, instead of catering to the highly specific needs of a minority of niche users (typically, argumentation scholars).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Paglieri","given":"Fabio"}],"container-title":"Philosophy & Technology","DOI":"10.1007/s13347-016-0222-6","ISSN":"2210-5433, 2210-5441","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,6]]},"language":"en","page":"209-238","source":"Crossref","title":"A Plea for Ecological Argument Technologies","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13347-016-0222-6","volume":"30"},

Drawing on literature from psychology, sociology, political science, communication, and information studies, the book provides a high-level framework of information sharing. The framework progresses through different categories. Information is first acquired or viewed from different sources; then, the target sharer has emotional and cognitive reactions to that information. The next categories involve motivations to share and the actual ability and perceptions of that ability to share. The greater context, such as culture, language, and social networks, also influences information sharing. Finally, the book distinguishes between genuine and non-genuine (inauthentic) actors.

Using empirical research on WhatsApp studies published from 2009 to 2019 as its corpus of data, this article systematically reviews them to provide more robust conclusions about WhatsApp and its relationship with political and/or civic engagement. This paper seeks to answer three central questions related to WhatsApp and engagement: 1) What are the motivations in using WhatsApp and how do they manifest in the use of WhatsApp as a communication tool? 2) What is the role of WhatsApp in civic and political engagement? 3) How do researchers study the use of WhatsApp in civic and political engagement? The review finds that across empirical studies, while WhatsApp is used by activists and organisational networks for mobilisation and coordinating actions, it is also used by users who draw on the affordances of the medium for informal and ‘de-politicised’ conversations. The findings contribute to the theorising of social media-mediated movements and activism and highlight methodological gaps of ongoing research on WhatsApp.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Pang","given":"Natalie"},{"family":"Woo","given":"Yue Ting"}],"container-title":"First Monday","DOI":"10.5210/fm.v25i12.10417","ISSN":"13960466","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,5]]},"language":"en","source":"firstmonday.org","title":"What about WhatsApp?

  {"id":"papacharissiAffectivePublicsSentiment2015","abstract":"\"Over the past few decades, we have witnessed the growth of movements using digital means to connect with broader interest groups and express their points of view. These movements emerge out of distinct contexts and yield different outcomes, but tend to share one thing in common: online and offline solidarity shaped around the public display of emotion. Social media facilitate feelings of engagement, in ways that frequently make people feel re-energized about politics. In doing so, media do not make or break revolutions but they do lend emerging, storytelling publics their own means for feeling their way into events, frequently by making those involved a part of the developing story. Technologies network us but it is our stories that connect us to each other, making us feel close to some and distancing us from others. Affective Publics explores how storytelling practices facilitate engagement among movements tuning into a current issue or event by employing three case studies: Arab Spring movements, various iterations of Occupy, and everyday casual political expressions as traced through the archives of trending topics on Twitter. It traces how affective publics materialize and disband around connective conduits of sentiment every day and find their voice through the soft structures of feeling sustained by societies. Using original quantitative and qualitative data, Affective Publics demonstrates, in this groundbreaking analysis, that it is through these soft structures that affective publics connect, disrupt, and feel their way into everyday politics\"--","author":[{"family":"Papacharissi","given":"Zizi"}],"call-number":"JF799.5 .P37 2015","collection-title":"Oxford studies in digital politics","event-place":"Oxford ; New York, NY","ISBN":"978-0-19-999973-6 978-0-19-999974-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"number-of-pages":"160","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"Oxford ; New York, NY","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Affective publics: sentiment, technology, and politics","title-short":"Affective publics","type":"book"},

Concern about such issues has contributed to give shape to the design space of sustainable HCI (SHCI); a space whose boundaries are at times blurred. On the one hand, some, design “sustainable” information technology based on visions of the world that do not really question limits to continuous economic growth and, on the other hand, others embrace the design of information technology from stances that acknowledges limits (i.e., economic, ecological, energetic). This paper introduces the perspective of social ecology into SHCI. This perspective provides us with a core set of principles that makes us situate computing at the intersection of physical (natural) and moral (human) qualities of our human environment systems.

As a result, we will all increasingly each live in our own unique information universe, what MoveOn.org board president Eli Pariser calls the 'filter bubble.' In this account, Pariser lays bare the personalization that is invisibly taking place on every major web site and reveals how it will limit what we are exposed to in the future, leaving less room for creativity, innovation, and the democratic exchange of ideas.","author":[{"family":"Pariser","given":"Eli"}],"ISBN":"978-0-14-312123-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"language":"English","note":"OCLC: 1085174583","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"The filter bubble: how the new personalized web is changing what we read and how we think","title-short":"The filter bubble","type":"book"},

  {"id":"parkComparingTwitterYouTube2015","abstract":"Grounded by the micro approach to network theory, information diffusion theory, and the web ecology model, this study comparatively explores the network structure, interaction pattern, and geographic distribution of users involved in communication networks of the Occupy Wall Street movement on Twitter and YouTube. The results show that Twitter users generated a loosely connected hub-and-spoke network, suggesting that information was likely to be organized by several central users in the network and that these users bridged small communities. On YouTube, homogeneously themed videos formed a dense mesh network, reinforcing shared ideas and meanings. According to the geographic distribution, both Twitter and YouTube networks were actively organized by U.S. users, but the YouTube network was activated mainly by anonymous users. These results highlight differing roles of social media in political information diffusion in which the Twitter network not only organizes and coordinates information but also facilitate the exchange of ideas between different groups. YouTube is suitable for disseminating ideas and reinforcing solidarity among members. The results demonstrate useful analytical techniques for data mining and analyzing Twitter and YouTube networks and have important implications for distinct roles of social media platforms in organizing collective action.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Park","given":"Se Jung"},{"family":"Lim","given":"Yon Soo"},{"family":"Park","given":"Han Woo"}],"container-title":"Technological Forecasting and Social Change","container-title-short":"Technological Forecasting and Social Change","DOI":"10.1016/j.techfore.2015.02.003","ISSN":"0040-1625","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"208-217","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Comparing Twitter and YouTube networks in information diffusion: The case of the “Occupy Wall Street” movement","title-short":"Comparing Twitter and YouTube networks in information diffusion","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162515000190","volume":"95"},

In doing so, the role of issue confidence was closely investigated. The current study adopts a non-profit organization’s use of political ideology and hoaxes in promoting labeling issues for GMO (genetically modified organisms) products. Results from an online survey with an embedded experiment showed that issue confidence is related to an individual’s motivation to engage in the GMO labeling issue, unlike factual knowledge or literacy. Findings suggested that social media hoaxes can activate individuals’ issue confidence.

A large platform may marginalize (or entirely block) potential connections between audiences and speakers. Consumer protection concerns arise, for platforms may be marketing themselves as open, comprehensive, and unbiased, when they are in fact closed, partial, and self-serving. Responding to protests, the accused platform either asserts a right to craft the information environment it desires, or abjures responsibility, claiming to merely reflect the desires and preferences of its user base. Such responses betray an opportunistic commercialism at odds with the platforms’ touted social missions. Large platforms should be developing (and holding themselves to) more ambitious standards for promoting expression online, rather than warring against privacy, competition, and consumer protection laws. These regulations enable a more vibrant public sphere. They also defuse the twin specters of monopolization and total surveillance, which are grave threats to freedom of expression.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Pasquale","given":"Frank"}],"container-title":"Theoretical Inquiries in Law","DOI":"10.1515/til-2016-0018","ISSN":"1565-1509, 1565-3404","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,1,1]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Platform neutrality: enhancing freedom of expression in spheres of private power","title-short":"Platform neutrality","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/til.2016.17.issue-2/til-2016-0018/til-2016-0018.xml","volume":"17"},

Such methods may reflect biases rather than reasoned decision making. They also may leave those affected by automated sorting and categorizing unable to understand the basis of the decisions affecting them. Despite these problems, machine-learning experts are feeding judicial opinions to algorithms to predict how future cases will be decided. We call the use of such predictive analytics in judicial contexts a jurisprudence of behaviourism as it rests on a fundamentally Skinnerian model of cognition as a black-boxed transformation of inputs into outputs. In this model, persuasion is passé; what matters is prediction. After describing and critiquing a recent study that has advanced this jurisprudence of behaviourism, we question the value of such research.

  {"id":"pasqualeRulePersonsNotForthcoming","abstract":"For many legal futurists, attorneys’ work is a prime target for automation. They view the legal practice of most businesses as algorithmic: data (such as facts) are transformed into outputs (agreements or litigation stances) via application of set rules. These technophiles promote substituting computer code for contracts and descriptions of facts now written by humans. They point to early successes in legal automation as proof of concept. TurboTax has helped millions of Americans file taxes, and algorithms have taken over certain aspects of stock trading. Corporate efforts to “formalize legal code” may bring new efficiencies in areas of practice characterized by both legal and factual clarity.However, legal automation can also elide or exclude important human values, necessary improvisations, and irreducibly deliberative governance. Due process, appeals, and narratively intelligible explanation from persons, for persons, depend on forms of communication that are not reducible to software. Language is constitutive of these aspects of law. To preserve accountability and a humane legal order, these reasons must be expressed in language by a responsible person. This basic requirement for legitimacy limits legal automation in several contexts, including corporate compliance, property recordation, and contracting. A robust and ethical legal profession respects the flexibility and subtlety of legal language as a prerequisite for a just and accountable social order. It ensures a rule of persons, not machines.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Pasquale","given":"Frank A."}],"container-title":"George Washington Law Review","issued":{"literal":"Forthcoming"},"language":"en","source":"papers.ssrn.com","title":"A Rule of Persons, Not Machines: The Limits of Legal Automation","title-short":"A Rule of Persons, Not Machines","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3135549"},

The particularity of these uprisings lies in the way the Internet is used to support them. Scholars have analyzed these movements as being closely related to a generation that relies on the Internet as a means of organizing themselves as a force of social change. That is, the Internet is seen as a way of promoting the active participation of young people in political issues. Public opinion and the mass media hail the Arab Spring revolutions as movements beneficial to the democratization of oppressive regimes. By contrast, when disobedient movements emerge in democratic countries, they are generally more cautious in evaluating these movements as enriching democracy. This cautious opinion also concerns the use of social media. In this article, the so-called Twitter revolutions are discussed in light of the theories of social psychology that analyze the relationship between disobedience and democracy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Passini","given":"Stefano"}],"container-title":"Human Affairs","DOI":"10.2478/s13374-012-0025-0","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"page":"301–312","source":"DeGruyter","title":"The facebook and Twitter revolutions: Active participation in the 21st century","title-short":"The facebook and Twitter revolutions","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/humaff.2012.22.issue-3/s13374-012-0025-0/s13374-012-0025-0.xml","volume":"22"},

This study explores how social media design features affect use of sources. A 2 × 2 between-subjects experiment examined effects of “information context collapse” (ICC)—where different content types are presented in the same form and location—and volume of content (VoC). These features were hypothesized to predict inattentive (System 1) processing, which predicts “source blindness”—where users fail to process source cues during news use. A mock social media site was created with participants queried about posts shown on the site. Results find that while VoC has no effect, ICC significantly predicts source blindness mediated by System 1 processing. This suggests collapsed information environments lead to inattentive processing of source information, increasing potential negative outcomes of social media news use. Implications of these findings are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Pearson","given":"George"}],"container-title":"New Media & Society","container-title-short":"New Media & Society","DOI":"10.1177/1461444820910505","ISSN":"1461-4448, 1461-7315","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,13]]},"language":"en","page":"146144482091050","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Sources on social media: Information context collapse and volume of content as predictors of source blindness","title-short":"Sources on social media","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1461444820910505"},

This study examines the current use of social media platforms and explores the factors that help define the long term implications of social media. The study employed a nationwide survey collected from 2012 to 2013 and is available from the PEW Internet research center of more than 2000 American citizens’ behaviour towards OSNs. The results revealed strong predictors of OSN that form the connections among users; and the core significant predictors: age, gender and access to mobile Internet that foster the adoption and usage of OSN in the future. Furthermore, online activities such as posting video content on social networks also highlighted the online usage patterns and trends of using social media to actively engage with other users more willingly than text. This is due to the viral nature of online media sharing on social media and as part of the video viewing and creating experience. An outline of practical implications of the findings and areas for future research is also discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Penni","given":"Janice"}],"container-title":"Telematics and Informatics","container-title-short":"Telematics and Informatics","DOI":"10.1016/j.tele.2016.10.009","ISSN":"0736-5853","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"498-517","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The future of online social networks (OSN): A measurement analysis using social media tools and application","title-short":"The future of online social networks (OSN)","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736585316302453","volume":"34"},

  {"id":"pennycookFightingMisinformationSocial2019","abstract":"Reducing the spread of misinformation, especially on social media, is a major challenge. We investigate one potential approach: having social media platform algorithms preferentially display content from news sources that users rate as trustworthy. To do so, we ask whether crowdsourced trust ratings can effectively differentiate more versus less reliable sources. We ran two preregistered experiments (n = 1,010 from Mechanical Turk and n = 970 from Lucid) where individuals rated familiarity with, and trust in, 60 news sources from three categories: (i) mainstream media outlets, (ii) hyperpartisan websites, and (iii) websites that produce blatantly false content (“fake news”). Despite substantial partisan differences, we find that laypeople across the political spectrum rated mainstream sources as far more trustworthy than either hyperpartisan or fake news sources. Although this difference was larger for Democrats than Republicans—mostly due to distrust of mainstream sources by Republicans—every mainstream source (with one exception) was rated as more trustworthy than every hyperpartisan or fake news source across both studies when equally weighting ratings of Democrats and Republicans. Furthermore, politically balanced layperson ratings were strongly correlated (r = 0.90) with ratings provided by professional fact-checkers. We also found that, particularly among liberals, individuals higher in cognitive reflection were better able to discern between low- and high-quality sources. Finally, we found that excluding ratings from participants who were not familiar with a given news source dramatically reduced the effectiveness of the crowd. Our findings indicate that having algorithms up-rank content from trusted media outlets may be a promising approach for fighting the spread of misinformation on social media.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Pennycook","given":"Gordon"},{"family":"Rand","given":"David G."}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1806781116","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,12]]},"language":"en","page":"2521-2526","PMID":"30692252","source":"Crossref","title":"Fighting misinformation on social media using crowdsourced judgments of news source quality","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1806781116","volume":"116"},
  {"id":"pennycookImpliedTruthEffect2020","abstract":"What can be done to combat political misinformation? One prominent intervention involves attaching warnings to headlines of news stories that have been disputed by third-party fact-checkers. Here we demonstrate a hitherto unappreciated potential consequence of such a warning: an implied truth effect, whereby false headlines that fail to get tagged are considered validated and thus are seen as more accurate. With a formal model, we demonstrate that Bayesian belief updating can lead to such an implied truth effect. In Study 1 (n = 5,271 MTurkers), we find that although warnings do lead to a modest reduction in perceived accuracy of false headlines relative to a control condition (particularly for politically concordant headlines), we also observed the hypothesized implied truth effect: the presence of warnings caused untagged headlines to be seen as more accurate than in the control. In Study 2 (n = 1,568 MTurkers), we find the same effects in the context of decisions about which headlines to consider sharing on social media. We also find that attaching verifications to some true headlines—which removes the ambiguity about whether untagged headlines have not been checked or have been verified—eliminates, and in fact slightly reverses, the implied truth effect. Together these results contest theories of motivated reasoning while identifying a potential challenge for the policy of using warning tags to fight misinformation—a challenge that is particularly concerning given that it is much easier to produce misinformation than it is to debunk it.This paper was accepted by Elke Weber, judgment and decision making.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Pennycook","given":"Gordon"},{"family":"Bear","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Collins","given":"Evan T."},{"family":"Rand","given":"David G."}],"container-title":"Management Science","container-title-short":"Management Science","DOI":"10.1287/mnsc.2019.3478","ISSN":"0025-1909","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,21]]},"publisher":"INFORMS","source":"pubsonline-informs-org.proxy.lib.uiowa.edu (Atypon)","title":"The Implied Truth Effect: Attaching Warnings to a Subset of Fake News Headlines Increases Perceived Accuracy of Headlines Without Warnings","title-short":"The Implied Truth Effect","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2019.3478"},
  {"id":"pennycookLazyNotBiased2019","abstract":"Why do people believe blatantly inaccurate news headlines (“fake news”)? Do we use our reasoning abilities to convince ourselves that statements that align with our ideology are true, or does reasoning allow us to eﬀectively diﬀerentiate fake from real regardless of political ideology? Here we test these competing accounts in two studies (total N = 3446 Mechanical Turk workers) by using the Cognitive Reﬂection Test (CRT) as a measure of the propensity to engage in analytical reasoning. We ﬁnd that CRT performance is negatively correlated with the perceived accuracy of fake news, and positively correlated with the ability to discern fake news from real news –even for headlines that align with individuals’ political ideology. Moreover, overall discernment was actually better for ideologically aligned headlines than for misaligned headlines. Finally, a headline-level analysis ﬁnds that CRT is negatively correlated with perceived accuracy of relatively implausible (primarily fake) headlines, and positively correlated with perceived accuracy of relatively plausible (primarily real) headlines. In contrast, the correlation between CRT and perceived accuracy is unrelated to how closely the headline aligns with the participant’s ideology. Thus, we conclude that analytic thinking is used to assess the plausibility of headlines, regardless of whether the stories are consistent or inconsistent with one’s political ideology. Our ﬁndings therefore suggest that susceptibility to fake news is driven more by lazy thinking than it is by partisan bias per se – a ﬁnding that opens potential avenues for ﬁghting fake news.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Pennycook","given":"Gordon"},{"family":"Rand","given":"David G."}],"container-title":"Cognition","container-title-short":"Cognition","DOI":"10.1016/j.cognition.2018.06.011","ISSN":"00100277","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"39-50","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Lazy, not biased: Susceptibility to partisan fake news is better explained by lack of reasoning than by motivated reasoning","title-short":"Lazy, not biased","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S001002771830163X","volume":"188"},
  {"id":"pennycookUnderstandingReducingSpread2019","abstract":"The spread of false and misleading news on social media is of great societal concern. Why do people share such content, and what can be done about it? In a first survey experiment (N=1,015), we demonstrate a dissociation between accuracy judgments and sharing intentions: even though true headlines are rated as much more accurate than false headlines, headline veracity has little impact on sharing. We argue against a “post-truth” interpretation, whereby people deliberately share false content because it furthers their political agenda. Instead, we propose that the problem is simply distraction: most people do not want to spread misinformation, but are distracted from accuracy by other salient motives when choosing what to share. Indeed, when directly asked, most participants say it is important to only share accurate news. Accordingly, across three survey experiments (total N=2775) and an experiment on Twitter in which we messaged N=5,482 users who had previously shared news from misleading websites, we find that subtly inducing people to think about the concept of accuracy decreases their sharing of false and misleading news relative to accurate news. Together, these results challenge the popular post-truth narrative. Instead, they suggest that many people are capable of detecting low-quality news content, but nonetheless share such content online because social media is not conducive to thinking analytically about truth and accuracy. Furthermore, our results translate directly into a scalable anti-misinformation intervention that is easily implementable by social media platforms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Pennycook","given":"Gordon"},{"family":"Epstein","given":"Ziv"},{"family":"Mosleh","given":"Mohsen"},{"family":"Arechar","given":"Antonio Alonso"},{"family":"Eckles","given":"Dean"},{"family":"Rand","given":"David Gertler"}],"DOI":"10.31234/osf.io/3n9u8","genre":"preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,13]]},"publisher":"PsyArXiv","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Understanding and reducing the spread of misinformation online","type":"report","URL":"https://osf.io/3n9u8"},
  {"id":"pennycookWhoFallsFake2019","abstract":"Objective: Fake news represents a particularly egregious and direct avenue by which inaccurate beliefs have been propagated via social media. We investigate the psychological profile of individuals who fall prey to fake news. Method: We recruited 1,606 participants from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk for three online surveys. Results: The tendency to ascribe profundity to randomly generated sentences – pseudo-profound bullshit receptivity – correlates positively with perceptions of fake news accuracy, and negatively with the ability to differentiate between fake and real news (media truth discernment). Relatedly, individuals who overclaim their level of knowledge also judge fake news to be more accurate. We also extend previous research indicating that analytic thinking correlates negatively with perceived accuracy by showing that this relationship is not moderated by the presence/absence of the headline’s source (which has no effect on accuracy), or by familiarity with the headlines (which correlates positively with perceived accuracy of fake and real news). Conclusion: Our results suggest that belief in fake news may be driven, to some extent, by a general tendency to be overly accepting of weak claims. This tendency, which we refer to as reflexive open-mindedness, may be partly responsible for the prevalence of epistemically suspect beliefs writ large.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Pennycook","given":"Gordon"},{"family":"Rand","given":"David G."}],"event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,22]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Social Science Research Network","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"papers.ssrn.com","title":"Who Falls for Fake News?

  {"id":"pennyIncentivesInequalitySelfRespect2013","abstract":"Rawls argues that ‘Parties in the original position would wish to avoid at almost any cost the social conditions that undermine self-respect’. But what are these social conditions that we should so urgently avoid? One evident candidate might be conditions of material inequality. Yet Rawls seems conﬁdent that his account of justice can endorse such inequalities without jeopardising citizens’ selfrespect. In this article I argue that this conﬁdence is misplaced. Unequalising incentives, I claim, jeopardise the self-respect of those least advantaged—at least under a Rawlsian schema—by undermining the very processes by which Rawls hopes to make distributional inequalities and self-respect compatible. I begin by setting out Rawls’s distinct account of self-respect before moving to describe how Rawls expects the difference principle to support citizens’ in this regard. I then draw upon GA Cohen’s distinction between ‘strict’ and ‘lax’ interpretations of the difference principle to argue that the presence of unequalising incentives undermines both the direct and indirect support that the difference principle can offer to citizens’ self-respect. As such, I claim that Rawls must either weaken his endorsement of unequalising incentives, or risk violating his ‘prior commitment’ to avoiding social conditions harmful to citizens’ self-respect.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Penny","given":"Richard"}],"container-title":"Res Publica","DOI":"10.1007/s11158-013-9225-7","ISSN":"1356-4765, 1572-8692","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,11]]},"language":"en","page":"335-351","source":"Crossref","title":"Incentives, Inequality and Self-Respect","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11158-013-9225-7","volume":"19"},

Here, we provide the first comprehensive assessment of the psychological syndrome that elicits motivations to share hostile political rumors among citizens of democratic societies. Against the notion that sharing occurs to help one mainstream political actor in the increasingly polarized electoral competition against other mainstream actors, we demonstrate that sharing motivations are associated with ‘chaotic’ motivations to “burn down” the entire established democratic ‘cosmos’. We show that this extreme discontent is associated with motivations to share hostile political rumors, not because such rumors are viewed to be true but because they are believed to mobilize the audience against disliked elites. We introduce an individual difference measure, the “Need for Chaos”, to measure these motivations and illuminate their social causes, linked to frustrated status-seeking. Finally, we show that chaotic motivations are surprisingly widespread within advanced democracies, having some hold in up to 40 percent of the American national population.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Petersen","given":"Michael Bang"},{"family":"Osmundsen","given":"Mathias"},{"family":"Arceneaux","given":"Kevin"}],"container-title":"PsyArXiv Preprints","DOI":"10.31234/osf.io/6m4ts","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,1]]},"language":"en","source":"psyarxiv.com","title":"A “Need for Chaos” and the Sharing of Hostile Political Rumors in Advanced Democracies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://psyarxiv.com/6m4ts/"},

These findings underscore the continued need to historicize modern race relations, yet intervening processes linking past violence with present events remain unclear.

We use mid-century measures of violent opposition to the Civil Rights Movement to bridge the historical gap between lynchings and later homicide, thus clarifying the dynamic and contingent nature of the legacy of racial violence. Structural equation models indicate that incidents of anti-civil rights enforcement and contemporary homicides are more likely to occur in areas with pronounced histories of lynching. Civil rights era assaults mediate the relationship between lynchings and contemporary homicide generally, but not White-on-Black homicide, signaling a need for further research documenting events of mid-century racial violence and clarifying these and other sources of historical transmission.

  {"id":"petreGamingSystemPlatform2019","abstract":"As the logic of data-driven metrification reconfigures various realms of social and economic life, cultural workers—from journalists and musicians to photographers and social media content creators—are pursuing online visibility in earnest. Despite workers’ patterned deployment of search engine optimization, reciprocal linking, and automated engagement-boosting, tech companies routinely denigrate such practices as gaming the system. This article critically probes discourses and practices of so-called system-gaming by analyzing three key moments when platforms accused cultural producers of algorithmic manipulation. Empirically, we draw upon textual analyses of news articles (n = 105) and user guidelines published by Google, Facebook, and Instagram. Our findings suggest that the line between what platforms deem illegitimate algorithmic manipulation and legitimate strategy is nebulous and largely reflective of their material interests. However, the language used to invoke this distinction is strongly normative, condemning “system gamers” as morally bankrupt, while casting platform companies as neutral actors working to uphold the ideals of authenticity and integrity. We term this dynamic “platform paternalism” and conclude that gaming accusations constitute an important mechanism through which platforms legitimate their power and authority, to the detriment of less well-established cultural producers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Petre","given":"Caitlin"},{"family":"Duffy","given":"Brooke Erin"},{"family":"Hund","given":"Emily"}],"container-title":"Social Media + Society","container-title-short":"Social Media + Society","DOI":"10.1177/2056305119879995","ISSN":"2056-3051","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"2056305119879995","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"“Gaming the System”: Platform Paternalism and the Politics of Algorithmic Visibility","title-short":"“Gaming the System”","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/2056305119879995","volume":"5"},

Professor Pettit's eloquent, compelling account opens with an examination of the traditional republican conception of freedom as non-domination, contrasting this with established negative and positive views of liberty. The first part traces the rise and decline of this conception, displays its many attractions, and makes a case for why it should still be regarded as a central political ideal. The second part looks at what the implementation of the ideal would imply for substantive policy-making, constitutional and democratic design, regulatory control and the relation between state and civil society. Prominent in this account is a novel concept of democracy, under which government is exposed to systematic contestation, and a vision of relations between state and society founded upon civility and trust. Professor Pettit's powerful and insightful new work offers not only a unified, theoretical overview of the many strands of republican ideas, it also provides a new and sophisticated perspective on studies in related fields including the history of ideas, jurisprudence, and criminology.","author":[{"family":"Pettit","given":"Philip"}],"collection-title":"A Theory of Freedom and Government","event-place":"Oxford : New York","ISBN":"0-19-152184-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1997]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"316","publisher":"Clarendon Press ; Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"Oxford : New York","title":"Republicanism: a theory of freedom and government","title-short":"Republicanism","type":"book","URL":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IWNQb4h-HmYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=pettit+republicanism&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api"},

Encountering this avalanche of antagonism every day may make some cultural critics, academics and journalists think, ‘the Internet is making everything worse!’ But, is\nthis really true? To answer the question, Whitney Phillips and Ryan M.

In doing so, they recognise that a lot of online activities embody seemingly contradictive dimensions and is therefore ambivalent.

  {"id":"phillipsThisWhyWe2015","abstract":"Why the troll problem is actually a culture problem: how online trolling fits comfortably within today's media landscape.Internet trolls live to upset as many people as possible, using all the technical and psychological tools at their disposal. They gleefully whip the media into a frenzy over a fake teen drug crisis; they post offensive messages on Facebook memorial pages, traumatizing grief-stricken friends and family; they use unabashedly racist language and images. They take pleasure in ruining a complete stranger's day and find amusement in their victim's anguish. In short, trolling is the obstacle to a kinder, gentler Internet. To quote a famous Internet meme, trolling is why we can't have nice things online. Or at least that's what we have been led to believe. In this provocative book, Whitney Phillips argues that trolling, widely condemned as obscene and deviant, actually fits comfortably within the contemporary media landscape. Trolling may be obscene, but, Phillips argues, it isn't all that deviant. Trolls' actions are born of and fueled by culturally sanctioned impulses—which are just as damaging as the trolls' most disruptive behaviors. Phillips describes, for example, the relationship between trolling and sensationalist corporate media—pointing out that for trolls, exploitation is a leisure activity; for media, it's a business strategy. She shows how trolls, “the grimacing poster children for a socially networked world,” align with social media. And she documents how trolls, in addition to parroting media tropes, also offer a grotesque pantomime of dominant cultural tropes, including gendered notions of dominance and success and an ideology of entitlement. We don't just have a trolling problem, Phillips argues; we have a culture problem. This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things isn't only about trolls; it's about a culture in which trolls thrive.","author":[{"family":"Phillips","given":"Whitney"}],"ISBN":"978-0-262-32900-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,3,20]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"251","publisher":"MIT Press","source":"Google Books","title":"This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things: Mapping the Relationship between Online Trolling and Mainstream Culture","title-short":"This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things","type":"book"},

  {"id":"picciottoWTOAppellateBody2005","abstract":"The creation of the Appellate Body (AB) of the WTO entails an unprecedented delegation of power to an international adjudicator, since the WTO requires states to ensure compliance of their domestic regulations with the sweeping obligations in WTO agreements. This is legitimized in some academic analysis and much political rhetoric in terms of the rule of law, suggesting that the role of the adjudicator is merely to apply the precise words of the texts agreed by states, according to their natural meaning. The AB has supported this, by adopting a formalist approach which combines an objectivist view of meaning with a legalistic style of judgement. However, both the general structure and many of the specific provisions of the WTO agreements are indeterminate and raise issues of interpretation which were known to be highly contestable. Although the delegation of adjudication in its early phase was considered to be of a narrow technical function, in the current phase interpretation is more clearly seen to involve a flexible application of principles to cases in the light of the policies involved. The AB’s role would be better legitimized by adopting a more open epistemology and reasoning which could be accessible to a wider constituency. However, it is constrained by fear of usurping the political legitimacy of the governments to which it is primarily accountable, and they in turn are motivated by a reluctance to admit to their domestic constituencies how much power has been transferred to supranational instances such as the AB.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Picciotto","given":"Sol"}],"container-title":"Governance","DOI":"10.1111/j.1468-0491.2005.00285.x","ISSN":"0952-1895, 1468-0491","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,7]]},"language":"en","page":"477-503","source":"Crossref","title":"The WTO's Appellate Body: Legal Formalism as a Legitimation of Global Governance","title-short":"The WTO's Appellate Body","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1468-0491.2005.00285.x","volume":"18"},

  {"id":"pickettDemeanorPoliceCulture2019","abstract":"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to revisit classic theoretical arguments regarding the broad effects of civilian demeanor on policing and extend associated findings. Design/methodology/approach The theoretical framework draws on insights from the literatures on police culture, the group engagement model and fairness heuristic theory. The authors argue that demeanor is best conceptualized as the degree of procedural justice exhibited by civilians toward police. Theoretically, procedurally just cooperation should influence officers’ adherence to police culture by affecting their social identification and assessments of civilians’ motives and moral deservingness. To test the hypotheses, the authors surveyed sworn officers from a large metropolitan police department in the southeastern USA in the Fall of 2016. Findings Results reveal that officers use their procedural justice judgments as heuristics to assess civilians’ trustworthiness, dangerousness, and moral deservingness, and these judgments influence their policing style. Officers who perceive greater procedurally just cooperation by civilians feel less threatened by the public, are more willing to use procedural justice themselves, and are less supportive of a “tough cop” policing style. Originality/value The authors propose that: civilian demeanor is best conceptualized as the extent to which civilians exhibit procedural fairness toward the police; and in order for meaningful police reform to occur, it is important to acknowledge the role of civilian demeanor in shaping officers’ attitudes, beliefs and behaviors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Pickett","given":"Justin"},{"family":"Nix","given":"Justin"}],"container-title":"Policing: An International Journal","DOI":"10.1108/PIJPSM-09-2018-0133","ISSN":"1363-951X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,1]]},"page":"537-555","publisher":"Emerald Publishing Limited","source":"Emerald Insight","title":"Demeanor and police culture: Theorizing how civilian cooperation influences police officers","title-short":"Demeanor and police culture","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1108/PIJPSM-09-2018-0133","volume":"42"},

  {"id":"plantinDigitalMediaInfrastructures2019","abstract":"Over the past decade, a growing body of scholarship in media studies and other cognate disciplines has focused our attention on the social, material, cultural, and political dimensions of the infrastructures that undergird and sustain media and communication networks and cultures across the world. This infrastructural turn assumes greater significance in relation to digital media and in particular, the influence that digital platforms have come to wield. Having ‘disrupted’ many sectors of social, political, and economic life, many of the most widely used digital platforms now seem to operate as infrastructures themselves. This special issue explores how an infrastructural perspective reframes the study of digital platforms and allows us to pose questions of scale, labor, industry logics, policy and regulation, state power, cultural practices, and citizenship in relation to the routine, everyday uses of digital platforms. In this opening article, we offer a critical overview of media infrastructure studies and situate the study of digital infrastructures and platforms within broader scholarly and public debates on the history and political economy of media infrastructures. We also draw on the study of media industries and production cultures to make the case for an inter-medial and inter-sectoral approach to understanding the entanglements of digital platforms and infrastructures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Plantin","given":"Jean-Christophe"},{"family":"Punathambekar","given":"Aswin"}],"container-title":"Media, Culture & Society","DOI":"10.1177/0163443718818376","ISSN":"0163-4437, 1460-3675","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,3]]},"language":"en","page":"163-174","source":"Crossref","title":"Digital media infrastructures: pipes, platforms, and politics","title-short":"Digital media infrastructures","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0163443718818376","volume":"41"},

By combining field theory and selected Science and Technology Studies (STS) concepts, the essay highlights the performative function of discourses in the field. It does so by showing how actors entered the policy field through the creation of expertise and regulatory competences and uncovers key conflicts that have shaped internet policy. Drawing on interviews and document analysis, the essay illustrates the proposed research approach via three selected examples which demonstrate how international discourses materialised in internet-related organisational structures and regulatory competences in German ministries.","author":[{"family":"Pohle","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Hösl","given":"Maximilian"},{"family":"Kniep","given":"Ronja"}],"issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","page":"21","source":"Zotero","title":"Analysing internet policy as a field of struggle","type":"article-journal","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"pondFinancialLiberalizationStable2018","abstract":"Why do autocratic rulers liberalize financial markets? This article shows how autocrats use financial liberalization for two distinct purposes. First, autocrats may use liberalization to bolster the economy, making revolution less attractive to the political opposition and stabilizing the autocracy. Second, when stabilization of the autocracy is too costly, autocrats may use liberalization to make assets more mobile. Mobility provides elite asset owners with external investment options, which limit redistribution. When redistribution is the main fear associated with democratization, the mobility associated with liberalization makes direct control of political institutions through dictatorship unnecessary. Thus, autocrats use liberalization to stimulate the economy and stabilize their rule or to reduce redistribution in anticipation of democratization. Suharto’s policies in Indonesia and Pinochet’s policies in Chile illustrate these two objectives of financial liberalization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Pond","given":"Amy"}],"container-title":"Comparative Political Studies","container-title-short":"Comparative Political Studies","DOI":"10.1177/0010414017695333","ISSN":"0010-4140","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"105-135","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Financial Liberalization: Stable Autocracies and Constrained Democracies","title-short":"Financial Liberalization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0010414017695333","volume":"51"},

The twin purposes of this mixed-methods case study are to describe the detainment and deportation processes, and their implementation at the Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia (notorious for its disparately high rate of deportation); and, to discuss social work’s ethical role in relation to immigrant populations and immigration policy issues. To achieve analysis, we collected data at the Stewart Detention Center, directly observing a sample of 39 immigration court hearings across 4 separate time points between June and September of 2018. We use univariate statistics to describe the sample in terms of hearing duration, demographics of detained persons, characteristics of judge and attorney interactions, removability charges, and hearing outcomes. Our analysis includes mappings of 2 courtrooms and a thick and rich narrative description of our first trip to the Stewart Detention Center in June, 2018. Identified themes across court observations include: (a) lack of uniformity in process, (b) adoption of criminal justice norms and procedures without inclusion of protective factors, (c) layers and barriers to communication that present as isolating, and (d) a seeming emphasis placed on the voluntary departure option. We conclude with a discussion of implications for social work and respective recommendations for engagement.","author":[{"family":"Poole","given":"Jennifer M"}],"issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"21","source":"Zotero","title":"A Snapshot of Immigration Court at Stewart Detention Center: How Social Workers Can Advocate & Advance Social Justice Efforts in the United States","type":"article-journal","volume":"20"},

In this essay, we argue that there is no such nondelegation doctrine: A statutory grant of authority to the executive branch or other agents never effects a delegation of legislative power. Agents acting within the terms of such a statutory grant are exercising executive power, not legislative power.

Design/methodology/approach: A comprehensive review of the literature that identifies common categories and factors that can be used to construct an analytical framework. Findings: Identifies student related, course related and teacher related aspects of research on teaching evaluations. Factors commonly addressed within these aspects are also identified. Research limitations/implications: Use of the framework to analyse the literature on the student evaluation of teaching (SET) process leads to the view that the time is right to explore other methods of assessing classroom dynamics that could supplement the conventional teacher evaluation process. Practical implications: Educational literature is replete with studies of the SET system, yet due to the preponderance of these studies, it is difficult to take an overview on the effectiveness of this system. On the basis of a comprehensive survey of the literature, this paper identifies and discusses the central factors influencing SET scores. These factors are then presented in a comprehensible table that can be used as a reference point for researchers and practitioners wishing to examine the effectiveness of the SET system.

  {"id":"pourebrahimUnderstandingCommunicationDynamics2019","abstract":"This study investigates Twitter usage during Hurricane Sandy following the survey of the general population and exploring communication dynamics on Twitter through different modalities. The results suggest that Twitter is a highly valuable source of disaster-related information particularly during the power outage. With a substantial increase in the number of tweets and unique users during the Hurricane Sandy, a large number of posts contained firsthand information about the hurricane showing the intensity of the event in real-time. More specifically, a number of images of damage and flooding were shared on Twitter through which researchers and emergency managers can retrieve valuable information to help identify storm damages and plan relief efforts. The social media analysis revealed the most important information that can be derived from twitter during disasters so that authorities can successfully utilize such data. The findings provide insights into the choice of keywords and sentiments and identifying the influential actors at different stages of disasters. A number of key influencers and their followers from different domains including political, news, weather, and relief organizations participated in Twitter-based discussions related to Hurricane Sandy. The connectivity of the influencers and their followers on Twitter plays a vital role in information sharing and dissemination throughout the hurricane. These connections can provide an effective vehicle for emergency managers towards establishing better bi-directional communication during disasters. However, while government agencies were among the prominent Twitter users during the Hurricane Sandy, they primarily relied on one-way communication rather than engaging with their audiences, a challenge that need to be addressed in future research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Pourebrahim","given":"Nastaran"},{"family":"Sultana","given":"Selima"},{"family":"Edwards","given":"John"},{"family":"Gochanour","given":"Amanda"},{"family":"Mohanty","given":"Somya"}],"container-title":"International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction","container-title-short":"International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijdrr.2019.101176","ISSN":"2212-4209","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"101176","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Understanding communication dynamics on Twitter during natural disasters: A case study of Hurricane Sandy","title-short":"Understanding communication dynamics on Twitter during natural disasters","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420918310434","volume":"37"},

This may seem strange at a time when legal protections for free expression remain strong and overt government censorship minimal. Yet a range of political, economic, social, and technological developments have raised profound challenges for how we manage speech. New threats to political discourse are mounting-from the rise of authoritarian populism and national security secrecy to the decline of print journalism and public trust in experts to the \"fake news,\" trolling, and increasingly subtle modes of surveillance made possible by digital technologies. The Perilous Public Square brings together leading thinkers to identify and investigate today's multifaceted threats to free expression. They go beyond the campus and the courthouse to pinpoint key structural changes in the means of mass communication and forms of global capitalism. Beginning with Tim Wu's inquiry into whether the First Amendment is obsolete, Matthew Connelly, Jack Goldsmith, Kate Klonick, Frederick Schauer, Olivier Sylvain, and Heather Whitney explore ways to address these dangers and preserve the essential features of a healthy democracy. Their conversations with other leading thinkers, including Danielle Citron, Jelani Cobb, Frank Pasquale, Geoffrey Stone, Rebecca Tushnet, and Kirsten Weld, cross the disciplinary boundaries of First Amendment law, internet law, media policy, journalism, legal history, and legal theory, offering fresh perspectives on fortifying the speech system and reinvigorating the public square\"--","call-number":"KF4770 .P47 2020","editor":[{"family":"Pozen","given":"David E."},{"literal":"Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University"}],"event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-231-19713-7 978-0-231-19712-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"publisher":"Columbia University Press","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"The perilous public square: structural threats to free expression today","title-short":"The perilous public square","type":"book"},

Except for incarceration, variables indicating increased use of the criminal justice system (e.g., policing and get-tough policy effects) are among the weakest.

  {"id":"presuelAlgorithmsNewsSocial2019","abstract":"With billons of users, social media platforms (e.g. Facebook) are dominant players in a highly-concentrated online news market. They have great power over the distribution of information to their users, and over the organizations and individuals that produce it. Social media platforms use algorithms to perform functions traditionally belonging to news editors: deciding on the importance of news items and how they are disseminated. However, they do not acknowledge the role they play in informing the public as traditional news media always have and tend to ignore that they also act as publishers of news and the responsibilities associated with that role. This paper argues that it is essential for social media platforms to understand and embrace their role as both news publishers and distributors and highlights the essential responsibilities they must undertake so they can satisfy the information needs of their audiences and protect the public’s right to information.","author":[{"family":"Presuel","given":"Cetina"}],"container-title":"Revista de Comunicación","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"25","source":"Zotero","title":"Algorithms and the News: Social Media Platforms as News Publishers and Distributors Algoritmos y noticias: Redes sociales como editores y distribuidores de noticias","type":"article-journal"},

The big push in recent years has been on the design of universal learning machines using optimization methods linear in the parameters, such as the Echo State Network, the Extreme Learning Machine and the Kernel Adaptive filter. We call this class of learning machines convex universal learning machines or CULMs. The purpose of the paper is to compare the methods behind these CULMs, highlighting their features using concepts of vector spaces (i.e. basis functions and projections), which are easy to understand by the computational intelligence community. We illustrate how two of the CULMs behave in a simple example, and we conclude that indeed it is practical to create universal mappers with convex adaptation, which is an improvement over backpropagation.","author":[{"family":"Principe","given":"J.

  {"id":"prodnikNoteOngoingProcesses2012","abstract":"The commodity-form played an important, if often overlooked, role in the studies of capitalism. Processes of transforming literally anything into a privatized form of (fictitious) commodity that is exchanged in the circulation process are of fundamental importance for the rise and reproduction of capitalism. At the same time the commodity, as the “cell-form of capitalism”, has played a crucial role throughout Marx’s oeuvre. The central aim of the paper is to demonstrate how the commodity-form develops in his works (both as a part of his “global” argument and in the context of historical changes) and what role it plays in some of the key works of critical theory. Furthermore, the aim is to show how this topic was approached in critical communication studies and has been analysed in the political economy of communication. The latter is done principally through a reappraisal of the “blind spot debate” initiated by Dallas W. Smythe and the audience commodity thesis, in which it was raised. This long-lasting debate, which at least indirectly continues to date, can be seen as an invaluable source for practices and ideas connected to both Marxian-inspired critical communication studies and to a serious analysis of the continuing commodification of different spheres of society and its increasing pervasiveness in contemporary life. In the last section, these findings are connected to some of the recent neo-Marxist approaches, especially to the findings of the authors coming from the autonomist (post-operaist) movement. Insights into this intellectual strand can provide an understanding of the ongoing commodification processes, while also offering possibilities of convergence with Smythe’s approach.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Prodnik","given":"Jernej"}],"container-title":"tripleC: Communication, Capitalism & Critique.

This article refreshes the critique by examining how impediments to users’ technical knowledge about how Web 2.0 platforms function affect user power.After reviewing how the scholarly literature on Web 2.0 accounts for the user knowledge/user power connection, this paper suggests Braman’s (2006) concept of “informational power” as a useful heuristic for exploring how access to information about how Web 2.0 platforms function operates as a “genetic” facet of user power. Then, using Braman’s framework, the article reviews two cases of struggle over informational power in regards to the Twitter platform: controversy over the Library of Congress Twitter archive and Occupy Wall Street protesters inaccurately accusing Twitter of censorship because of a misunderstanding about “Trending Topics.” Through the application of Braman’s framework to these cases, it becomes clear how users’ prospects for developing technical knowledge about the platforms shape the limits and horizons of individual and collective power.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Proferes","given":"Nicholas"}],"container-title":"First Monday","DOI":"10.5210/fm.v21i6.6793","ISSN":"13960466","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,6,10]]},"language":"en","source":"journals.uic.edu","title":"Web 2.0 user knowledge and the limits of individual and collective power","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/6793","volume":"21"},

Democracy prevails in developed societies because too much is at stake in turning against it. More income can be redistributed in developed than in poor countries without threatening democracy.

Exploring Rousseau's views on lawmaking and the complexities associated with legislative initiation, specifically, this essay challenges the notion that representatives or legislative experts in a democracy inevitably reduce popular participation to acclamation. Contrary to authors who believe that Rousseau surreptitiously devolves political power to an elected elite who predecide a legislative agenda for a passive majority to vote upon later, I argue that the philosopher delegates authority to initiate the laws to representatives without undermining either the sovereignty or the robustness of citizen self-rule.

  {"id":"radinBoilerplate2012","abstract":"Boilerplate--the fine-print terms and conditions that we become subject to when we click \"I agree\" online, rent an apartment, enter an employment contract, sign up for a cellphone carrier, or buy travel tickets--pervades all aspects of our modern lives. On a daily basis, most of us accept boilerplate provisions without realizing that should a dispute arise about a purchased good or service, the nonnegotiable boilerplate terms can deprive us of our right to jury trial and relieve providers of responsibility for harm. Boilerplate is the first comprehensive treatment of the problems posed by the increasing use of these terms, demonstrating how their use has degraded traditional notions of consent, agreement, and contract, and sacrificed core rights whose loss threatens the democratic order. Margaret Jane Radin examines attempts to justify the use of boilerplate provisions by claiming either that recipients freely consent to them or that economic efficiency demands them, and she finds these justifications wanting. She argues, moreover, that our courts, legislatures, and regulatory agencies have fallen short in their evaluation and oversight of the use of boilerplate clauses. To improve legal evaluation of boilerplate, Radin offers a new analytical framework, one that takes into account the nature of the rights affected, the quality of the recipient's consent, and the extent of the use of these terms. Radin goes on to offer possibilities for new methods of boilerplate evaluation and control, among them the bold suggestion that tort law rather than contract law provides a preferable analysis for some boilerplate schemes. She concludes by discussing positive steps that NGOs, legislators, regulators, courts, and scholars could take to bring about better practices.","author":[{"family":"Radin","given":"Margaret Jane"}],"collection-title":"The Fine Print, Vanishing Rights, and the Rule of Law","ISBN":"1-4008-4483-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"number-of-pages":"360","publisher":"Princeton University Press","title":"Boilerplate","title-short":"Boilerplate","type":"book","URL":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9msIi5VHEs0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=radin+boilerplate&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api"},

In two of the three field studies, individuals spent more once the decision to spend had been made. Study 2 then shows that consumers deliberately choose to receive money in a large denomination relative to small denominations when there is a need to exert self‐control in spending. Study 3 further shows that the denomination effect is contingent on individual differences in people’s desire to reduce the pain of paying associated with spending. The results suggest that the denomination effect occurs because large denominations are psychologically less fungible than smaller ones, allowing them to be used as a strategic device to control and regulate spending.","author":[{"family":"Raghubir","given":"Priya"},{"family":"Srivastava","given":"Joydeep"}],"container-title":"Journal of Consumer Research","DOI":"10.1086/599222?ref=search-gateway:513b55a7c97650a197fc981289b6bf47","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"page":"701-713","title":"The Denomination Effect","title-short":"The Denomination Effect","type":"article-journal","volume":"36"},

I then explore some recent efforts toward using the Internet and social media to provide alternative means for addressing these scalability challenges, under the banners of crowdsourcing and computer-supported argumentation.

In reality, knowledge is commoditized and objectified as decontextualized representations. More information may mean that the society is drawn into a critical phase where loss of knowledge occurs with the unlimited flow of information. Such ubiquitous information could lead to less understanding, less trust and less truth, which would erode rationality in the governance of the society. Using a framework based on Michel Foucault’s archeological methodology, i.e., unearthing how information and communication technologies (ICT) came to be viewed as a source of truth/knowledge, this paper explores the question: Do ICT contribute information that can be construed as knowledge? Does this knowledge contribute to truth or to power?

Secondly, it argues that subjectivist orthodoxy in doctrine may be reconciled with the apparently antithetical forms of regulatory strict liability law within the terms of ‘modern democratic citizenship’ as the latter were conceptualised by T.

Finally, by means of a comparison with Alan Brudner's recent philosophical rationalisation of the modern criminal law, it proposes that situating the criminal law in its environment of citizenship will help us to understand better the tensions that underlie contemporary challenges to its doctrine.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Ramsay","given":"Peter"}],"container-title":"The Modern Law Review","DOI":"10.1111/j.1468-2230.2006.00575.x","ISSN":"1468-2230","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006]]},"language":"en","page":"29-58","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The Responsible Subject As Citizen: Criminal Law, Democracy And The Welfare State","title-short":"The Responsible Subject As Citizen","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2230.2006.00575.x","volume":"69"},

Today, while the U.S. enjoys tremendous military and economic power, citizens are increasingly insulated from everyday decision-making. This was not always the case. America, [the author] argues, began as a settler society grounded in an ideal of freedom as the exercise of continuous self-rule―one that joined direct political participation with economic independence. However, this vision of freedom was politically bound to the subordination of marginalized groups, especially slaves, Native Americans, and women. These practices of liberty and exclusion were not separate currents, but rather two sides of the same coin. However, at crucial moments, social movements sought to imagine freedom without either subordination or empire. By the mid-twentieth century, these efforts failed, resulting in the rise of hierarchical state and corporate institutions. This new framework presented national and economic security as society’s guiding commitments and nurtured a continual extension of America’s global reach.

  {"id":"ranchordasPublicValuesPrivate2019","abstract":"Abstract \n            In traditional sectors, the intervention of private parties in the regulatory system tends to be justified by their enhanced expertise, government cuts or efficiency gains. In the sharing economy (e.g., home-sharing services offered by Airbnb), quality control and regulatory tasks (e.g., inspections) are to, a great extent, informally delegated to online platforms and peer-to-peer communities that rate and review performance. These communities consist of users that do not have more than their personal experience and the guidance of online platforms to underpin their assessments. Existing literature has extensively criticized the reliability of these online reputational mechanisms, but it has overlooked other far-reaching effects of outsourcing regulatory tasks to private parties. This Article offers a more complete analysis of the regulatory value of online reputation. I argue that reputational mechanisms have the potential of creating democratic spaces where users can provide unique, regular, and first-hand insights that would otherwise be disregarded in a traditional regulatory system. Nevertheless, in their current form, these mechanisms still offer inadequate protection to the public values that typically underlie the regulation of certain services. This Article explains this problem by comparing the protection of public values in the sharing economy to that of traditional regulated sectors. \n            This Article contributes to the literature by reflecting on whether the sharing economy is inviting us to rethink the broader involvement of citizens in the protection of public values and the challenges thereof. It suggests a framework to improve online reputational mechanisms and a better dialogue between traditional regulation and online reputation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Ranchordás","given":"Sofia"}],"container-title":"The Law & Ethics of Human Rights","DOI":"10.1515/lehr-2019-2005","ISSN":"2194-6531, 1938-2545","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,18]]},"page":"203-237","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Public Values, Private Regulators: Between Regulation and Reputation in the Sharing Economy","title-short":"Public Values, Private Regulators","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/lehr.2019.13.issue-2/lehr-2019-2005/lehr-2019-2005.xml","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"rawlsJusticeFairness2001","abstract":"This book originated as lectures for a course on political philosophy that Rawls taught regularly at Harvard in the 1980s. In time the lectures became a restatement of his theory of justice as fairness, revised in light of his more recent papers and his treatise Political Liberalism (1993). As Rawls writes in the preface, the restatement presents \"in one place an account of justice as fairness as I now see it, drawing on all [my previous] works.\" He offers a broad overview of his main lines of thought and also explores specific issues never before addressed in any of his writings. Rawls is well aware that since the publication of A Theory of Justice in 1971, American society has moved farther away from the idea of justice as fairness. Yet his ideas retain their power and relevance to debates in a pluralistic society about the meaning and theoretical viability of liberalism. This book demonstrates that moral clarity can be achieved even when a collective commitment to justice is uncertain.","author":[{"family":"Rawls","given":"John"}],"collection-editor":[{"family":"Kelly","given":"Erin"}],"collection-title":"A Restatement","ISBN":"978-0-674-00510-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2001]]},"number-of-pages":"214","publisher":"Harvard University Press","title":"Justice as Fairness","title-short":"Justice as Fairness","type":"book","URL":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AjrXZIlbK1cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=justice+as+fairness+a+restatement&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api"},

Haters and manipulators often seem to monopolize the conversation. Some comments are off-topic, or even topic-less. In this book, Joseph Reagle urges us to read the comments. Conversations “on the bottom half of the Internet,” he argues, can tell us much about human nature and social behavior.Reagle visits communities of Amazon reviewers, fan fiction authors, online learners, scammers, freethinkers, and mean kids. He shows how comment can inform us (through reviews), improve us (through feedback), manipulate us (through fakery), alienate us (through hate), shape us (through social comparison), and perplex us. He finds pre-Internet historical antecedents of online comment in Michelin stars, professional criticism, and the wisdom of crowds. He discusses the techniques of online fakery (distinguishing makers, fakers, and takers), describes the emotional work of receiving and giving feedback, and examines the culture of trolls and haters, bullying, and misogyny. He considers the way comment—a nonstop stream of social quantification and ranking—affects our self-esteem and well-being. And he examines how comment is puzzling—short and asynchronous, these messages can be slap-dash, confusing, amusing, revealing, and weird, shedding context in their passage through the Internet, prompting readers to comment in turn, “WTF?!?”","author":[{"family":"Reagle","given":"Joseph M.

  {"id":"reederLibertySwordJamaican2017","abstract":"Examining dialogue about the Jamaican maroon treaties of 1739, this article locates the Haitian Revolution within a wider constellation of events that contributed to a reconceptualization of slave resistance in the United States. During the early republic, Americans drew on combined images of the Haitian Revolution, the Second Maroon War, and the Second Seminole War as they reconceived of the Jamaican maroons and their association with the violent assertion of liberty. Between 1739 and the 1780s, Anglo-Atlantic whites viewed the maroons as having rightfully won their liberty through violent resistance and as helpful allies of the Jamaican slave society. During the 1790s, confronted with the violence in Saint-Domingue and the Second Maroon War in Jamaica, some white observers began to question the mid-eighteenth-century wisdom of compromising with rebellious blacks. Others referenced the maroon treaties in recommending pragmatic negotiations with Saint-Domingue to reestablish stability in the Caribbean. Such references signified the surprising persistence of the notion that legitimizing slave resistance by treaty could diffuse an otherwise disastrous race war. Finally, between the 1810s and the Civil War, Americans dichotomized discourse about the maroons into pro- and antislavery narratives, both of which strayed from predominant eighteenth-century descriptions of the maroons. Advocates of slavery challenged the perception of the maroons as a legitimately free body of people contributing to the stability of society. In contrast, slavery’s detractors cast them as racial warriors fighting against bondage rather than as a community of free blacks allied with the slavocracy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Reeder","given":"Tyson"}],"container-title":"Journal of the Early Republic","DOI":"10.1353/jer.2017.0002","ISSN":"1553-0620","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,2,23]]},"language":"en","page":"81-115","publisher":"University of Pennsylvania Press","source":"Project MUSE","title":"Liberty with the Sword: Jamaican Maroons, Haitian Revolutionaries, and American Liberty","title-short":"Liberty with the Sword","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://muse.jhu.edu/article/649278","volume":"37"},

  {"id":"reevesReasonsLawDworkin2016","abstract":"Ronald Dworkin once identified the basic question of jurisprudence as: ‘What, in general, is a good reason for a decision by a court of law?’ I argue that, over the course of his career, Dworkin gave an essentially sound answer to this question. In fact, he gave a correct answer to a broader question: ‘What is a good reason for a legal decision, generally?’ For judges, officials of executive and administrative agencies, lawyers, non-governmental organizations, and ordinary subjects acting in the variety of legal contexts, Dworkin identified the proper basis for a legal decision, and its implications for the form of well-conducted legal reasoning. Dworkin's stance on the above questions can be characterised by two theses. I defend his view by substantiating each. The result is agnostic about the viability of other aspects of Dworkin's legal theory, as it focuses on the grounds of proper legal decision-making. Whatever the fate of his other philosophical views, Dworkin's jurisprudence includes a clear-headed, though morally challenging, understanding of the proper basis for decisions of law.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Reeves","given":"Anthony R."}],"container-title":"Jurisprudence","DOI":"10.1080/20403313.2015.1082818","ISSN":"2040-3313","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,5,3]]},"page":"210-230","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Reasons of Law: Dworkin on the Legal Decision","title-short":"Reasons of Law","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/20403313.2015.1082818","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"rehmanShariaIslamicFamily2007","abstract":"This article assesses the compatibility of the Sharia and Islamic family laws with international human rights law. As a subject of enormous complexity and variation, detailed examination is restricted to two of the highly contentious subjects of Islamic family laws – polygamy and the Talaq (unilateral divorce given by the husband) within Islam. It is argued that while the Quran and Sunna remain the principal foundations of the Sharia, the formulation of a legally binding code from primarily ethical and religious sources has not been an uncontested matter. It is also submitted that the Sharia and Islamic family laws that eventually emerged during the second and third centuries of the Muslim calendar were heavily inﬂuenced by the socio-economic, political and indigenous tribal values of the prevailing times. During the development phases of the classical legal schools, the Islamic jurists frequently adopted male-centric approaches towards women’s rights and family laws. As regards polygamy and the Talaq it is only recently (and with considerable reservations) that Islamic societies have allowed a debate and enquiry into the reform of established norms of the Sharia. Attempts to rectify the injustices built into the prevailing system of polygamous marriages and unilateral Talaq procedures have resulted in some, albeit limited, success through the process of directly appealing to the primary sources of the Sharia. The article concludes with the view that the Sharia and Islamic family laws are likely to remain relevant to Islamic societies as well as to English Law – a consistent review and re-interpretation of the Sharia is therefore of utmost signiﬁcance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,10,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Rehman","given":"J."}],"container-title":"International Journal of Law, Policy and the Family","DOI":"10.1093/lawfam/ebl023","ISSN":"1360-9939, 1464-3707","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,3,6]]},"language":"en","page":"108-127","source":"Crossref","title":"The Sharia, Islamic Family Laws and International Human Rights Law: Examining the Theory and Practice of Polygamy and Talaq","title-short":"The Sharia, Islamic Family Laws and International Human Rights Law","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/lawfam/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/lawfam/ebl023","volume":"21"},

To date, however, even the best histories of social work have focused primarily on the influence of mainstream (i.e. white) organizations and their leaders, ignoring and often objectifying the contributions of minorities. Based on extensive primary source materials, this essay—part of a larger scholarly project—analyses the differential responses of US social work to demographic and cultural changes during the past century. The findings illuminate discussions not only of social work’s past, but how the profession could address such contemporary issues as the compatibility between multiculturalism and other social justice-related goals; the congruence between social equality and professional identity; and the means by which social work practice and ethics can adapt successfully to demographic and cultural transformation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Reisch","given":"M."}],"container-title":"British Journal of Social Work","DOI":"10.1093/bjsw/bcn001","ISSN":"0045-3102, 1468-263X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,4,15]]},"language":"en","page":"788-804","source":"Crossref","title":"From Melting Pot to Multiculturalism: The Impact of Racial and Ethnic Diversity on Social Work and Social Justice in the USA","title-short":"From Melting Pot to Multiculturalism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/bjsw/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bjsw/bcn001","volume":"38"},

The issue of violence and brutality against African American males along with the police shooting of unarmed African American males has become a reality of the denial of these rights for some in America. Recent police shooting incidents of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Tamir Rice in Cleveland, Ohio, in addition to the brutal murder by police of Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York, have sparked riots, looting, protests, “die-ins,” and national conversations. The subsequent civil unrest across the United States and abroad has attracted widespread public attention. In this article, three authors respond by providing a timely trilogy of uniquely diverse perspectives and viewpoints on these issues giving particular attention to (1) the view from a historical lens and Black Power political framework producing an analysis of the causative factors promoting and sustaining violence against African American males, (2) an examination of criminal justice law, and (3) a look at our way forward.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Rembert","given":"David A."},{"family":"Watson","given":"Jerry"},{"family":"Hill","given":"Rickey"}],"container-title":"Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment","DOI":"10.1080/10911359.2015.1083506","ISSN":"1091-1359","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,2,17]]},"page":"227-235","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"A trilogy of trepidation: Diverse perspectives on police violence targeting African American males","title-short":"A trilogy of trepidation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10911359.2015.1083506","volume":"26"},

  {"id":"remsterShiftingPowerImpact","abstract":"While prisoners cannot vote, they are counted as residents of the often rural legislative districts where they are incarcerated rather than their home districts. We examine the extent to which incarceration shifts the balance of a representative democracy by considering its impact on legislative apportionment. Drawing on data from the Census, Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, and Pennsylvania Redistricting Commission, we develop a counterfactual framework to examine whether removing and returning prisoners to their home districts affects equal representation. Because prisoners are disproportionately African American, we also employ this counterfactual to assess racial differences in the impact of prison gerrymandering. Findings indicate that incarceration shifts political power from urban districts to suburban and rural districts through legislative apportionment. Moreover, non-White communities suffer the most. We conclude by considering how our findings fit a growing literature on the role of mass incarceration in [re]producing racial inequalities in the contemporary United States.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Remster","given":"Brianna"},{"family":"Kramer","given":"Rory"}],"DOI":"10.31235/osf.io/egd72","language":"en","source":"DataCite","title":"Shifting Power: The Impact of Incarceration on Political Representation","title-short":"Shifting Power","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://osf.io/egd72"},

  {"id":"resendeMisInformationDissemination2019","abstract":"WhatsApp has revolutionized the way people communicate and interact. It is not only cheaper than the traditional Short Message Service (SMS) communication but it also brings a new form of mobile communication: the group chats. Such groups are great forums for collective discussions on a variety of topics. In particular, in events of great social mobilization, such as strikes and electoral campaigns, WhatsApp group chats are very attractive as they facilitate information exchange among interested people. Yet, recent events have raised concerns about the spreading of misinformation in WhatsApp. In this work, we analyze information dissemination within WhatsApp, focusing on publicly accessible political-oriented groups, collecting all shared messages during major social events in Brazil: a national truck drivers' strike and the Brazilian presidential campaign. We analyze the types of content shared within such groups as well as the network structures that emerge from user interactions within and cross-groups. We then deepen our analysis by identifying the presence of misinformation among the shared images using labels provided by journalists and by a proposed automatic procedure based on Google searches. We identify the most important sources of the fake images and analyze how they propagate across WhatsApp groups and from/to other Web platforms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Resende","given":"Gustavo"},{"family":"Melo","given":"Philipe"},{"family":"Sousa","given":"Hugo"},{"family":"Messias","given":"Johnnatan"},{"family":"Vasconcelos","given":"Marisa"},{"family":"Almeida","given":"Jussara"},{"family":"Benevenuto","given":"Fabrício"}],"collection-title":"WWW '19","container-title":"The World Wide Web Conference","DOI":"10.1145/3308558.3313688","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-6674-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"page":"818–828","publisher":"ACM","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"(Mis)Information Dissemination in WhatsApp: Gathering, Analyzing and Countermeasures","title-short":"(Mis)Information Dissemination in WhatsApp","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3308558.3313688"},

This portion of their campaign strategy was disproportionately targeted toward younger voters, since those between 18 and 25 comprise a vast portion of Snapchat’s user base. Did their efforts, those of political parties, or those of interest groups on Snapchat produce higher levels of civic engagement among college students? We utilize a survey that we conducted from a college campus in the Midwest in October 2016 to answer this question.

In some cases, the risk of democratization to authoritarian incumbents is so low that ending authoritarianism might not mean exiting power at all. This article develops a unified theory of authoritarianled democratization under conditions of relatively low incumbent risk. We argue that the party strength of the authoritarian incumbent is the most pivotal factor in authoritarian-led democratization. When incumbent party strength has been substantial enough to give incumbent authoritarian politicians significant electoral victory confidence, nondemocratic regimes have pursued reversible democratic experiments that eventually culminated in stable, thriving democracies. Evidence from Europe’s first wave of democratization and more recent democratic transitions in Taiwan and Ghana illustrate how party strength has underpinned authoritarian-led democratization across the world and across modern history.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Riedl","given":"Rachel Beatty"},{"family":"Slater","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Wong","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Ziblatt","given":"Daniel"}],"container-title":"Annual Review of Political Science","container-title-short":"Annu.

  {"id":"robertsDigitalDetritusError2018","abstract":"The late 2016 case of the Facebook content moderation controversy over the infamous Vietnam-era photo, “The Terror of War,” is examined in this paper for both its specifics, as well as a mechanism to engage in a larger discussion of the politics and economics of the content moderation of user-generated content. In the context of mainstream commercial social media platforms, obfuscation and secrecy work together to form an operating logic of opacity, a term and concept introduced in this paper. The lack of clarity around platform policies, procedures and the values that inform them lead users to wildly different interpretations of the user experience on the same site, resulting in confusion in no small part by the platforms’ own design. Platforms operationalize their content moderation practices under a complex web of nebulous rules and procedural opacity, while governments and other actors clamor for tighter controls on some material, and other members of civil society demand greater freedoms for online expression. Few parties acknowledge the fact that mainstream social media platforms are already highly regulated, albeit rarely in such a way that can be satisfactory to all. The final turn in the paper connects the functions of the commercial content moderation process on social media platforms like Facebook to their output, being either the content that appears on a site, or content that is rescinded: digital detritus. While meaning and intent of user-generated content may often be imagined to be the most important factors by which content is evaluated for a site, this paper argues that its value to the platform as a potentially revenue-generating commodity is actually the key criterion and the one to which all moderation decisions are ultimately reduced. The result is commercialized online spaces that have far less to offer in terms of political and democratic challenge to the status quo and which, in fact, may serve to reify and consolidate power rather than confront it.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Roberts","given":"Sarah T."}],"container-title":"First Monday","DOI":"10.5210/fm.v23i3.8283","ISSN":"13960466","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,1]]},"language":"en","source":"journals.uic.edu","title":"Digital detritus: 'Error' and the logic of opacity in social media content moderation","title-short":"Digital detritus","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/8283","volume":"23"},

  {"id":"robisonGroupBasisPartisan2019","abstract":"What explains rising partisan animosity in the United States? We argue that mass partisans’ feelings toward the social group coalitions of the parties are an important cause of rising affective polarization. We first leverage evidence from the American National Election Study (ANES) Time Series to show that partisans’ feelings toward the social groups linked to their in-party (out-party) have grown more positive (negative) over time. We then turn to the 1992–96 and 2000–2004 ANES Panel Surveys to disentangle the interrelationship between partisan polarization and social group evaluations. Individuals with more polarized social group evaluations in 1992 or 2000 report substantially more polarized party thermometer ratings and more extreme, and better sorted, partisan identities four years later. Notably, these variables exerted little reciprocal influence on group evaluations. Our study has important implications for understanding affective polarization and the role of social groups in public opinion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Robison","given":"Joshua"},{"family":"Moskowitz","given":"Rachel L."}],"container-title":"The Journal of Politics","container-title-short":"The Journal of Politics","DOI":"10.1086/703069","ISSN":"0022-3816","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,6]]},"source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"The Group Basis of Partisan Affective Polarization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/703069"},

  {"id":"rodriguezDeprovincialisingPoliceViolence2012","abstract":"On 18 November 2011, students at the University of California, Davis staged a protest as part of the Occupy movement. The reaction of the on-site police force was heavy-handed, and images of an officer pepper-spraying the faces of peacefully protesting college students provoked widespread criticism of the police’s repression of non-violent dissent. However, this reaction, the author argues, betrays a deeper racism in the consciousness of the US Left; while this particular scene of policing has provoked liberal anger, it has been isolated from the historical conditions that enabled it. The very similar policing of African Americans is excluded from the narrative of state violence, taking for granted the fundamentally racist structure of US policing. Is it possible, asks the author, that the critical response to events at UC Davis is actually condoning this racist structure rather than challenging it?","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Rodríguez","given":"Dylan"}],"container-title":"Race & Class","container-title-short":"Race & Class","DOI":"10.1177/0306396812444831","ISSN":"0306-3968","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"99-109","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"De-provincialising police violence: on the recent events at UC Davis","title-short":"De-provincialising police violence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0306396812444831","volume":"54"},

The era was characterized by thinkers who promoted progressive social reforms that opposed the long-established aristocracies and monarchies of the time. Prominent examples of such reforms include the establishment of inalienable human rights, self-governing republics, and market capitalism. Twenty-first century democratic nations can benefit from revisiting the systems developed during the Enlightenment and reframing them within the techno-social context of the Information Age. This article explores the application of social algorithms that make use of Thomas Paine's (English: 1737-1809) representatives, Adam Smith's (Scottish: 1723-1790) self-interested actors, and Marquis de Condorcet's (French: 1743-1794) optimal decision making groups.

What are we to make of the use of “Citizens” in the title given the denial of political rights to African Americans? This essay argues that the pamphlet relies on the cultural and linguistic norms associated with the term appeal in order to call into existence the political standing of black folks. Walker’s use of citizen does not need to rely on a recognitive legal relationship precisely because it is the practice of judging that illuminates one’s political, indeed, citizenly standing. Properly understood, the Appeal aspires to transform blacks and whites, and when it informs the prophetic dimension of the text, it tilts the entire pamphlet in a democratic direction. This is the political power of the pamphlet; it exemplifies the call-and-response logic of democratic self-governance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Rogers","given":"Melvin L."}],"container-title":"Political Theory","container-title-short":"Political Theory","DOI":"10.1177/0090591714523623","ISSN":"0090-5917","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"208-233","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"David Walker and the Political Power of the Appeal","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0090591714523623","volume":"43"},

In challenging the prevailing view of this essay, I argue that Dewey defends a fundamental indeterminacy in the idea of ““the people”” that implies a necessary, but productive tension between relative stability and emerging disruptions. The latter, he argues, holds out hope that the power of ““the people”” can be redirected, thus redeeming the sacrifices of the minority and retaining their identification with ““the people.”” For Dewey, the idea of ““the people”” means that, though democracy entails sacrifice, the legitimacy of the political system demands faith that it will be redeemed. Although this view is first captured in 1888, it receives amplification in his later writings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Rogers","given":"Melvin L."}],"container-title":"Transactions of the Charles S.

Publicly accessible web-based student evaluations of teaching are of particular relevance, due to their widespread use by students in the course selection process and the quantity of data available for analysis. In this study, data from the most popular of these websites, RateMyProfessors.com, is analysed for correlations between measures of instruction quality, easiness, physical attractiveness, discipline and gender. This study of 7,882,980 RateMyProfessors ratings (from 190,006 US professors with at least 20 student ratings) provides further insight into student perceptions of academic instruction and possible variables in student evaluations. Positive correlations were observed between ratings of instruction quality and easiness, as well as between instruction quality and attractiveness. On average, professors in science and engineering disciplines have lower ratings than in the humanities and arts. When looking at RateMyProfessors as a whole, the effect of a professor’s gender on rating criteria is small but statistically significant. When analysing the data as a function of discipline, however, the effects of gender are significantly more pronounced, albeit more complex. The potential implications are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Rosen","given":"Andrew S."}],"container-title":"Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education","DOI":"10.1080/02602938.2016.1276155","ISSN":"0260-2938","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,2]]},"page":"31-44","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Correlations, trends and potential biases among publicly accessible web-based student evaluations of teaching: a large-scale study of RateMyProfessors.com data","title-short":"Correlations, trends and potential biases among publicly accessible web-based student evaluations of teaching","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/02602938.2016.1276155","volume":"43"},

This paper focuses on the development of the concept of autochthony, as far as our sources allow, in an effort to understand better what autochthony meant to the Athenians. In particular it considers how the Athenians came to think of themselves as ‘born from the earth’.

However, these studies have been mostly focused on analyzing the use of digital platforms without considering contextual factors of the race, like public opinion polling data. Polling data is an important information source for both citizens and candidates, and provides the latter with information that might drive strategic communication. In this paper, we explore the relationship between the use of social media in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Elections and candidates' standing in public opinion polls focusing on the surfacing and primary stages of the campaign. We are also interested in understanding whether candidates use Twitter and Facebook in similar ways. We used automated content analysis to categorize social media posts from all 21 Republican and Democratic candidates that ran for president in 2016. Specifically, we are interested in observing whether a candidate's performance in the polls drives certain communicative strategies, such as the use of attacks and messages of advocacy, as well as the focus on personal image or policy issues.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Rossini","given":"Patrícia G.

  {"id":"rossIroniesControllingState2008","abstract":"Control mechanisms and their effects are seldom analyzed in the subject matter of state crime. When what might be viewed as legitimate attempts to rectify a given situation occur, it happens all too often that well-intended individuals (i.e., advocates) and/or organizations can become additional victims of state crime. This truism has rarely been systematically reviewed. We aim to ﬁll this gap by ﬁrst identifying the government’s most typical reactions to attempts of control, including the process of legitimatizing the state’s efforts to frustrate the establishment of constraints on government agencies and actions. This paper examines the unintended consequences (i.e., things that they did not reasonably expect) that individuals and/or organizations may incur if and when they confront states that engage in criminal activity. The authors outline eight core reactions and then apply categories to recent actions by the US government in response to attempts of control against state criminality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Ross","given":"Jeffrey Ian"},{"family":"Rothe","given":"Dawn L."}],"container-title":"International Journal of Law, Crime and Justice","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijlcj.2008.06.001","ISSN":"17560616","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,9]]},"language":"en","page":"196-210","source":"Crossref","title":"Ironies of controlling state crime","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1756061608000311","volume":"36"},

I provide an overview and analysis of the dispute resolution processes used by the community and will look to the successes and limitation of these processes. A number of flaws will be identified including the ability for vocal minorities to dominate the Wikipedia community consensus. A systemic bias will be identified in the behavioural landscape of the community and, finally, it will become apparent that there is room for growth in the website’s inclusiveness, primarily through addressing the logistical realities of a potential user’s access to the time, materials, and knowledge needed to become a contributing member of the Wikipedia community.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Ross","given":"Sara"}],"container-title":"SSRN Electronic Journal","container-title-short":"SSRN Journal","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.2495196","ISSN":"1556-5068","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Your Day in 'Wiki-Court': ADR, Fairness, and Justice in Wikipedia's Global Community","title-short":"Your Day in 'Wiki-Court'","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2495196"},

  {"id":"rothmanConflictEngagementContingency","abstract":"The systematic study and applied practice of conflict resolution is now a few decades old and is evolving into its own field and perhaps towards its own discipline (Avruch, 2013). I believe an essential way forward towards a more robust field and discipline is to build a parsimonious contingency approach. That is, an approach for applying our best theoretical and analytical tools to diagnosing the nature and status of a given conflict and then systematically and adaptively matching up the best methods for constructively engaging the conflict as it evolves. Fisher and Keashly (1991) pioneered contingency theory in international conflict resolution, while Sander and Goldberg suggested “fitting the forum to the fuss” in domestic ADR a few years later (1994). Since then the notion has caught on and is now somewhat in “vogue” (Fisher, 2012). However, surprisingly little development has occurred in this arena given the promise it holds. The contingency model described in this article builds on this early theorizing and suggests different conflict intervention methods according to conflict type and stage of development. Conflicts are divided into three different types: resourcebased, objectives-based and identity-based. Each type is conducive to a different mode of engagement.","author":[{"family":"Rothman","given":"Jay"}],"issue":"2","language":"en","page":"15","source":"Zotero","title":"Conflict Engagement: A Contingency Model in Theory and Practice","type":"article-journal","volume":"21"},

By focusing on care, the study calls for technical innovation that integrates moderators’ aims with artificial intelligence systems. Rather than acknowledging human skills and resources in terms of moderation tools and discussion culture, the current platform logic forces moderators to operate like machines. Their discontent becomes understandable within a logic that diminishes their skills and vision. The moderator is left with assessing separate posts, rather than offering a meta-perspective to the discussion, overseeing and nurturing it.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Ruckenstein","given":"Minna"},{"family":"Turunen","given":"Linda Lisa Maria"}],"container-title":"New Media & Society","container-title-short":"New Media & Society","DOI":"10.1177/1461444819875990","ISSN":"1461-4448","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,19]]},"language":"en","page":"17","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Re-humanizing the platform: Content moderators and the logic of care","title-short":"Re-humanizing the platform","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444819875990"},

The latest technological revolution—the digital revolution—is no exception in this respect. This paper presents the revolution brought about by digital technologies through the lenses of a specific approach: the philosophy of information. It is argued that the adoption of an informational approach helps avoiding utopian or dystopian approaches to (digital) technology, both expressions of technological determinism. Such an approach provides a conceptual framework able to address the ethical challenges that digital technologies pose, without getting stuck in the dichotomous thinking of technological determinism, and to bring together ethics, ontology, and epistemology into a coherent account.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Russo","given":"Federica"}],"container-title":"Philosophy & Technology","DOI":"10.1007/s13347-018-0326-2","ISSN":"2210-5433, 2210-5441","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,12]]},"language":"en","page":"655-667","source":"Crossref","title":"Digital Technologies, Ethical Questions, and the Need of an Informational Framework","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13347-018-0326-2","volume":"31"},

Yet, we know very little about how immigration judges make their decisions, including decisions about whether to release or detain noncitizens pending the completion of their immigration cases. Using original data on long-term immigrant detainees, I examine for the first time judicial decision making in immigration bond hearings. I find that there are extremely wide variations in the average bond grant rates and bond amount decisions among judges in the study sample. What are the determinants of these bond decisions? My analysis shows that the odds of being granted bond are more than 3.5 times higher for detainees represented by attorneys than those who appeared pro se, net of other relevant factors. My analysis also shows that the detainees' prior criminal history is the only significant legally relevant factor in both the grant/deny and bond amount decisions, net of other relevant factors. This finding points to the need for further research on whether and how immigration courts might be exercising crime control through administrative proceedings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Ryo","given":"Emily"}],"container-title":"Law & Society Review","DOI":"10.1111/lasr.12177","ISSN":"1540-5893","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","page":"117-153","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Detained: A Study of Immigration Bond Hearings","title-short":"Detained","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/lasr.12177","volume":"50"},

  {"id":"sabelLearningDifferenceNew2008","abstract":"This article argues that current widespread characterisations of EU governance as multi-level and networked overlook the emergent architecture of the EU’s public rule making. In this architecture, framework goals (such as full employment, social inclusion, ‘good water status’, a uniﬁed energy grid) and measures for gauging their achievement are established by joint action of the Member States and EU institutions. Lower-level units (such as national ministries or regulatory authorities and the actors with whom they collaborate) are given the freedom to advance these ends as they see ﬁt. But in return for this autonomy, they must report regularly on their performance and participate in a peer review in which their results are compared with those pursuing other means to the same general ends. Finally, the framework goals, performance measures, and decision-making procedures themselves are periodically revised by the actors, including new participants whose views come to be seen as indispensable to full and fair deliberation. Although this architecture cannot be read off from either Treaty provisions or textbook accounts of the formal competences of EU institutions, the article traces its emergence and diffusion across a wide range of policy domains, including telecommunications, energy, drug authorisation, occupational health and safety, employment promotion, social inclusion, pensions, health care, environmental protection, food safety, maritime safety, ﬁnancial services, competition policy, state aid, anti-discrimination policy and fundamental rights.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Sabel","given":"Charles F."},{"family":"Zeitlin","given":"Jonathan"}],"container-title":"European Law Journal","DOI":"10.1111/j.1468-0386.2008.00415.x","ISSN":"1351-5993, 1468-0386","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,5]]},"language":"en","page":"271-327","source":"Crossref","title":"Learning from Difference: The New Architecture of Experimentalist Governance in the EU","title-short":"Learning from Difference","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1468-0386.2008.00415.x","volume":"14"},

That one can know the streets and shops, avenues and alleys, while also going days without being recognized. But as elites fill cities with “smart” technologies — turning them into platforms for the “Internet of Things” (IoT): sensors and computation embedded within physical objects that then connect, communicate, and/or transmit information with or between each other through the Internet — there is little escape from a seamless web of surveillance and power. This paper will outline a social theory of the “smart city” by developing our Deleuzian concept of the “spectrum of control.” We present two illustrative examples: biometric surveillance as a form of monitoring, and automated policing as a particularly brutal and exacting form of manipulation. We conclude by offering normative guidelines for governance of the pervasive surveillance and control mechanisms that constitute an emerging critical infrastructure of the “smart city.”","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Sadowski","given":"Jathan"},{"family":"Pasquale","given":"Frank"}],"container-title":"First Monday","DOI":"10.5210/fm.v20i7.5903","ISSN":"13960466","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,6,24]]},"language":"en","source":"journals.uic.edu","title":"The spectrum of control: A social theory of the smart city","title-short":"The spectrum of control","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/5903","volume":"20"},

  {"id":"salterMedievalRepresentativeAssemblies2018","abstract":"Medieval monarchs in Western Europe responded to financial and military pressures by instituting representative assemblies. Three estates (classes; orders) were represented in these assemblies: clergy, nobility, and burghers. In the late medieval and early modern periods, some states tended towards absolutism (e.g., France); others towards constitutional monarchy (e.g., England). The German historian Otto Hintze conjectured that two-chamber assemblies were more likely to resist monarchical encroachments on their political authority than three-chamber assemblies. We argue that the two- versus three-chamber distinction is coincidental to what was truly relevant: whether chambers were estate-based or had mixed representation from multiple estates. We provide a comparative institutional analysis that emphasizes political bargaining and the costs of expressing special versus common interests. This analysis suggests that mixed representation assemblies, all else equal, provided a stronger check on absolutism than their estate-based counterparts. We also provide historical case studies of France and England that lend insights into why an estate-based Estates General arose in the former, while a mixed representation Parliament arose in the latter.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Salter","given":"Alexander William"},{"family":"Young","given":"Andrew T."}],"container-title":"Constitutional Political Economy","DOI":"10.1007/s10602-018-9258-1","ISSN":"1043-4062, 1572-9966","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,6]]},"language":"en","page":"171-192","source":"Crossref","title":"Medieval representative assemblies: collective action and antecedents of limited government","title-short":"Medieval representative assemblies","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10602-018-9258-1","volume":"29"},

Because she believes that city-regions should be more politically autonomous does not mean that she believes that each should have only one municipal government. Jacobs never confuses the municipality as an institution of local government with the city-region as an incubator of economic activity.

Structured by the Governing Knowledge Commons (GKC) framework, the study illustrates how rules-in-use creatively support appropriate information flows and govern information resources to balance community objectives and privacy. Interviews, contextualized by participant surveys and Facebook data, illustrate: the importance of (1) polycentric governance and (2) private decision-making in public Facebook groups used by activists, and (3) privacy protecting institutions governing common knowledge resources shared within and across movements.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Sanfilippo","given":"Madelyn Rose"},{"family":"Strandburg","given":"Katherine J."}],"container-title":"Information, Communication & Society","DOI":"10.1080/1369118X.2019.1668458","ISSN":"1369-118X","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,26]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2019.1668458","page":"1-18","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Privacy governing knowledge in public Facebook groups for political activism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2019.1668458","volume":"0"},
  {"id":"sanfilippoTopicPolarizationPush2019","abstract":"In the fake news era, a combination of politics, big technology, and fear and animosity are blamed for the media mistrust and filter bubbles that are entrenching fragmentation in the public sphere. A partisan divide in the media and extreme political disagreements are nothing new, but new technology, such as social media and mobile push notifications, influences these years-old phenomena and plays an important role in current concerns. This paper explores how stories are represented differently by topic and across platforms, examining representation, polarization, and objectivity. Specifically, this paper looks at those issues from a novel perspective: through sentiment analysis of push notifications generated and archived from the Breaking News App on disasters, gun violence, and terrorism. Results indicate that partisan news organizations (1) emphasize different stories; (2) label the same events as categorically different; (3) hyperbolize and emotionalize different types of stories; and, (4) represent different categories of breaking news stories to different degrees of subjectivity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Sanfilippo","given":"Madelyn Rose"},{"family":"Lev-Aretz","given":"Yafit"}],"container-title":"First Monday","DOI":"10.5210/fm.v24i9.9604","ISSN":"13960466","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,31]]},"language":"en","source":"journals.uic.edu","title":"Topic polarization and push notifications","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/9604","volume":"24"},

Users can change both opinions and social connections based on the information to which they are exposed through sharing. Model dynamics demonstrate that even with minimal amounts of influence and unfriending, the social network rapidly devolves into segregated, homogeneous communities. These predictions are consistent with empirical data from Twitter. Although our findings suggest that echo chambers are somewhat inevitable given the mechanisms at play in online social media, they also provide insights into possible mitigation strategies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Sasahara","given":"Kazutoshi"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Wen"},{"family":"Peng","given":"Hao"},{"family":"Ciampaglia","given":"Giovanni Luca"},{"family":"Flammini","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Menczer","given":"Filippo"}],"container-title":"arXiv:1905.03919 [physics]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,9]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"On the Inevitability of Online Echo Chambers","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03919"},

This essay shows that these three ideas are conceptually separate, so the transition from any one to another stands in need of further substantive argument, which is not always adequately given. It does this by offering an alternative decision-making mechanism, called lottery voting, in which all individuals cast votes for their preferred options but, instead of these being counted, one is randomly selected and that vote determines the outcome. This procedure is democratic and egalitarian, since all have an equal chance to influence outcomes, but obviously not majoritarian.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Saunders","given":"Ben"}],"container-title":"Ethics","container-title-short":"Ethics","DOI":"10.1086/656474","ISSN":"0014-1704","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,10,1]]},"page":"148-177","source":"www-journals-uchicago-edu.proxy.lib.uiowa.edu (Atypon)","title":"Democracy, Political Equality, and Majority Rule","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/656474","volume":"121"},

These leaders aim to consolidate power and to remain in office indefinitely, eventually eliminating the ability of democratic publics to exercise their basic dem- ocratic rights, to hold leaders accountable, and to change their leaders peacefully. Because these “legalistic autocrats” deploy the law to achieve their aims, impending autocracy may not be evident at the start. But we can learn to spot the legalistic autocrats before autocratic constitutionalism becomes fatal because they are often following a script using tactics that they borrow from each other. This Essay ex- plains the paths that these autocratic legalists take, the danger signals that accom- pany their legal reforms, and the methods they use to dismantle liberal constitutions. The Essay also suggests how the legalistic autocrats may be stopped.","author":[{"family":"Scheppele","given":"Kim Lane"}],"container-title":"University of Chicago Law Review","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"page":"545-583","title":"Autocratic Legalism","type":"article-journal","volume":"85"},

  {"id":"schluterApplicationSESFramework2014","abstract":"Social-ecological systems (SES) are dynamic systems that continuously change in response to internal or external pressures. A better understanding of the interactions of the social and ecological systems that drive those dynamics is crucial for the development of sustainable management strategies. Dynamic models can serve as tools to explore social-ecological interactions; however, the complexity of the studied systems and the need to integrate knowledge, theories, and approaches from different disciplines pose considerable challenges for their development. We assess the potential of Ostrom’s general SES framework (SESF) to guide a systematic and transparent process of model development in light of these difficulties. We develop a stepwise procedure for applying SESF to identify variables and their relationships relevant for an analysis of the SES. In doing so we demonstrate how the hierarchy of concepts in SESF and the identification of social-ecological processes using the newly introduced process relationships can help to unpack the system in a systematic and transparent way. We test the procedure by applying it to develop a dynamic model of decision making in the management of recreational fisheries. The added value of the common framework lies in the guidance it provides for (1) a structured approach to identifying major variables and the level of detail needed, and (2) a procedure that enhances model transparency by making explicit underlying assumptions and choices made when selecting variables and their interactions as well as the theories or empirical evidence on which they are based. Both aspects are of great relevance when dealing with the complexity of SES and integrating conceptual backgrounds from different disciplines. We discuss the advantages and difficulties of the application of SESF for model development, and contribute to its further refinement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Schlüter","given":"Maja"},{"family":"Hinkel","given":"Jochen"},{"family":"Bots","given":"Pieter W.

In this paper, we explore the anatomy of the information space on Facebook by characterizing on a global scale the news consumption patterns of 376 million users over a time span of 6 y (January 2010 to December 2015). We find that users tend to focus on a limited set of pages, producing a sharp community structure among news outlets. We also find that the preferences of users and news providers differ.

  {"id":"schreieckChallengeGoverningDigital2018","abstract":"Multi‐sided platforms (MSPs) continue to disrupt long‐established industries. Therefore, there is a growing popularity to scientifically examine how and why those platforms become more and more economically important. The centerpiece to orchestrate the interaction between the involved parties is the platform governance. While past studies concentrated on describing and identifying those mechanisms, this article aims to provide more detailed knowledge of the practical implications of implementing platform mechanisms differently. With this goal in mind, the article conducted a literature review to identify important platform governance mechanisms. Building on that, a multiple case analysis was carried out examining seven successful MSPs and how they governed their platform. The results indicate that platform governance mechanisms are incorporated in different shapes and characteristics. The governance structure, for example, ranged from a very centralistic and autocratic organization to a more split approach with empowerment on the user side. Also, the accessibility varies from a high degree of openness to detailed background checks users need to pass in order to participate in the platform. Out of these findings, different tradeoffs can be derived. A high degree of openness, for example, goes along with a greater quantity of products or services, but lacks in quality and indicates a higher perceived risk. Overall this article shows the practical implications and characteristics of different platform governance characteristics and helps practitioners and scientists to learn from successful MSPs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Schreieck","given":"Maximilian"},{"family":"Hein","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Wiesche","given":"Manuel"},{"family":"Krcmar","given":"Helmut"}],"container-title":"Digital Marketplaces Unleashed","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-662-49275-8_47","editor":[{"family":"Linnhoff-Popien","given":"Claudia"},{"family":"Schneider","given":"Ralf"},{"family":"Zaddach","given":"Michael"}],"event-place":"Berlin, Heidelberg","ISBN":"978-3-662-49275-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","page":"527-538","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher-place":"Berlin, Heidelberg","source":"Springer Link","title":"The Challenge of Governing Digital Platform Ecosystems","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-49275-8_47"},
  {"id":"schreieckGoverningNonprofitPlatform2017","abstract":"The number of refugees arriving in Europe increased dramatically in 2015. Following arrival at the host country, refugees need access to information on various topics such as applying for asylum, medical care, educational offerings, jobs, or social activities. As many different parties using different channels provide this information, refugees struggle to access relevant information at the right time. Our goal in addressing this information deficit is to support a digital information platform for refugees by developing a governance strategy for the ecosystem of information providers. Within an action research study based on a nonprofit project, we evaluate the implementation of governance mechanisms derived from platform and community governance literature. Our results show that governance mechanisms are implemented differently for nonprofit platform ecosystems than for commercial platform ecosystems. These results enhance the societal impact of the information platform developed in the project. The study contributes to theory on governance of platform ecosystems and IT-enabled collaboration by evaluating established governance mechanisms in the context of nonprofit platforms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Schreieck","given":"Maximilian"},{"family":"Wiesche","given":"Manuel"},{"family":"Krcmar","given":"Helmut"}],"container-title":"Information Technology for Development","container-title-short":"Information Technology for Development","DOI":"10.1080/02681102.2017.1335280","ISSN":"0268-1102","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,7,3]]},"page":"618-643","source":"www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.uiowa.edu (Atypon)","title":"Governing nonprofit platform ecosystems – an information platform for refugees","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02681102.2017.1335280","volume":"23"},

  {"id":"schumannSocialMediaUse2019","abstract":"Vote shares for populist radical right parties (PRRPs) have increased considerably in recent years, and this advancement of PRRPs has been attributed in part to social media. We assess the affinity between social media and populist radical right parties by examining a) whether more frequent social media use for news enhances the willingness to vote for a PRRP (exposure effect) as well as b) whether individuals who have voted for a PRRP in the past use social media more frequently to access news (selection effect). To address these research questions, we analysed data of a two-wave survey study that was conducted in Germany, focusing on the party Alternative for Germany (AfD). Binary logistic regression highlighted that social media use increased the likelihood of supporting the AfD. Pre-registered multinominal analyses, however, showed that this effect was driven by specific party comparisons. That is, using the AfD as a reference category, social media use reduced intentions to vote for parties that expressed similar positions as the AfD on the issue of immigration and with which the PRRP competes over votes. Social media selection effects were not supported.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Schumann","given":"Sandy"},{"family":"Boer","given":"Diana"},{"family":"Hanke","given":"Katja"},{"family":"Liu","given":"James"}],"container-title":"Information, Communication & Society","DOI":"10.1080/1369118X.2019.1668455","ISSN":"1369-118X","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,5]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2019.1668455","page":"1-20","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Social media use and support for populist radical right parties: assessing exposure and selection effects in a two-wave panel study","title-short":"Social media use and support for populist radical right parties","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2019.1668455","volume":"0"},

  {"id":"schwartzBroadcastHysteriaOrson2015","abstract":"On the evening of October 30, 1938, radio listeners across the United States heard a startling report of a meteor strike in the New Jersey countryside. With sirens blaring in the background, announcers in the field described mysterious creatures, terrifying war machines, and thick clouds of poison gas moving toward New York City. As the invading force approached Manhattan, some listeners sat transfixed, while others ran to alert neighbors or to call the police. Some even fled their homes. But the hair-raising broadcast was not a real news bulletin-it was Orson Welles's adaptation of the H. G. Wells classic The War of the Worlds. In Broadcast Hysteria, A. Brad Schwartz boldly retells the story of Welles's famed radio play and its impact. Did it really spawn a \"wave of mass hysteria,\" as The New York Times reported? Schwartz is the first to examine the hundreds of letters sent to Orson Welles himself in the days after the broadcast, and his findings challenge the conventional wisdom. Few listeners believed an actual attack was under way. But even so, Schwartz shows that Welles's broadcast became a major scandal, prompting a different kind of mass panic as Americans debated the bewitching power of the radio and the country's vulnerability in a time of crisis. When the debate was over, American broadcasting had changed for good, but not for the better. As Schwartz tells this story, we observe how an atmosphere of natural disaster and impending war permitted broadcasters to create shared live national experiences for the first time. We follow Orson Welles's rise to fame and watch his manic energy and artistic genius at work in the play's hurried yet innovative production. And we trace the present-day popularity of \"fake news\" back to its source in Welles's show and its many imitators. Schwartz's original research, gifted storytelling, and thoughtful analysis make Broadcast Hysteria a groundbreaking new look at a crucial but little-understood episode in American history.","author":[{"family":"Schwartz","given":"A.

They also solidify markets; that is, social networks of exchange that do not necessarily leave data traces, into infrastructure, that is, material arrangements of traceable activity. This article examines the forms of domination found in this digital platform model, and corrects some existing simplistic theoretical conclusions about digital platforms. It first provides a schematic overview of digital infrastructures of governance, and the attendant systemic mechanics they engender. It then argues that we need a more syncretic, interdisciplinary approach to the platform-based economy. The shifting emphases of different academic disciplines in relation to digital platforms are only partially grounded in their different normative biases; they can also be attributed to use of different disciplinary lenses. The field of information systems management and design studies is chiefly concerned with direct, technical interplatform affordances and connections, and with providing observations of certain systemic attributes of digital platforms. Critical political economy, by contrast, mainly considers the emerging transnational, geopolitical formations of platform capitalism. The interplay between these different systemic mechanics is summarized and presented here in the concept of “platform logic.”","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Schwarz","given":"Jonas Andersson"}],"container-title":"Policy & Internet","DOI":"10.1002/poi3.159","ISSN":"1944-2866","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","page":"374-394","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Platform Logic: An Interdisciplinary Approach to the Platform-Based Economy","title-short":"Platform Logic","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/poi3.159","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"scottSocialFactsLegal2017","abstract":"This article explores a core question in the law of slavery: how was an individual's status as slave or free socially discerned and formally adjudicated? Under the doctrine of “freedom by prescription,” a person who had in good faith “lived as free” could argue that the absence of exercise of ownership for a specified term of years extinguished a prior owner's title. In the medieval Siete Partidas of Alfonso the Wise, which continued as a legal point of reference in Louisiana well after the end of Spanish rule, both the law of status and the law of property confirmed this path to freedom. From 1808 onward, Louisiana jurists and legislators sought to eliminate the remnants of the doctrine, but it lingered in popular and even judicial consciousness. The 1853 kidnapping of a woman named Eulalie Oliveau, six of her children, and eleven of her grandchildren for sale in the New Orleans slave market brought the question of “freedom by prescription” back into the courts. The awkward resolution of that case, and the uncertain fate of Eulalie Oliveau and her children, foreshadowed Reconstruction-era struggles over the content of legal freedom and the rights that freedom might bring to those who had once been held as property.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Scott","given":"Rebecca J."}],"container-title":"Law and History Review","DOI":"10.1017/S0738248016000560","ISSN":"0738-2480, 1939-9022","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,2]]},"language":"en","page":"9-30","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Social Facts, Legal Fictions, and the Attribution of Slave Status: The Puzzle of Prescription","title-short":"Social Facts, Legal Fictions, and the Attribution of Slave Status","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/law-and-history-review/article/social-facts-legal-fictions-and-the-attribution-of-slave-status-the-puzzle-of-prescription/46BF3149D2EA3AB1A54703274E31190B","volume":"35"},
  {"id":"scottSocialScientificApproach2017","abstract":"We analyze data from 213 metropolitan areas over a 21-year period, and examine two possible reasons for the disproportionately high number of Black suspects killed in police officer-involved shootings. One account suggests that such shootings reflect racial bias on the part of police. A second account suggests that Black suspects behave differently (perhaps more aggressively) than White suspects, and that police respond to suspects’ behavior (but not race). Our analysis statistically controls for racial differences in criminal activity (a proxy for behavior) and provides a statistical test of the effect of race on police shootings. Results suggest that officers are more likely to shoot Black suspects, even when race-based differences in crime are held constant.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Scott","given":"Kendra"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Debbie S."},{"family":"Sadler","given":"Melody S."},{"family":"Correll","given":"Joshua"}],"container-title":"Journal of Social Issues","DOI":"10.1111/josi.12243","ISSN":"1540-4560","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","page":"701-722","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"A Social Scientific Approach toward Understanding Racial Disparities in Police Shooting: Data from the Department of Justice (1980–2000)","title-short":"A Social Scientific Approach toward Understanding Racial Disparities in Police Shooting","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/josi.12243","volume":"73"},

  {"id":"searQuantifyingCOVID19Content2020","abstract":"A huge amount of potentially dangerous COVID-19 misinformation is appearing online. Here we use machine learning to quantify COVID-19 content among online opponents of establishment health guidance, in particular vaccinations (\"anti-vax\"). We find that the anti-vax community is developing a less focused debate around COVID-19 than its counterpart, the pro-vaccination (“pro-vax”) community. However, the anti-vax community exhibits a broader range of “flavors” of COVID-19 topics, and hence can appeal to a broader cross-section of individuals seeking COVID-19 guidance online, e.g. individuals wary of a mandatory fast-tracked COVID-19 vaccine or those seeking alternative remedies. Hence the anti-vax community looks better positioned to attract fresh support going forward than the pro-vax community. This is concerning since a widespread lack of adoption of a COVID-19 vaccine will mean the world falls short of providing herd immunity, leaving countries open to future COVID-19 resurgences. We provide a mechanistic model that interprets these results and could help in assessing the likely efficacy of intervention strategies. Our approach is scalable and hence tackles the urgent problem facing social media platforms of having to analyze huge volumes of online health misinformation and disinformation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Sear","given":"R.F."},{"family":"Velasquez","given":"N."},{"family":"Leahy","given":"R."},{"family":"Restrepo","given":"N.

  {"id":"seetharamanFacebookExecutivesShut2020","abstract":"The social-media giant internally studied how it polarizes users and how it might address the resulting harms, then largely shelved the research.\n\nFacebook Knows It Encourages Division. Top Executives Nixed Solutions.\nThe social-media giant internally studied how it polarizes users, then largely shelved the research\nA Facebook Inc. team had a blunt message for senior executives. The company’s algorithms weren’t bringing people together. They were driving people apart.\n“Our algorithms exploit the human brain’s attraction to divisiveness,” read a slide from a 2018 presentation. “If left unchecked,” it warned, Facebook would feed users “more and more divisive content in an effort to gain user attention & increase time on the platform.”\nThat presentation went to the heart of a question dogging Facebook almost since its founding: Does its platform aggravate polarization and tribal behavior?\nThe answer it found, in some cases, was yes.\nFacebook had kicked off an internal effort to understand how its platform shaped user behavior and how the company might address potential harms. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg had in public and private expressed concern about “sensationalism and polarization.”\nBut in the end, Facebook’s interest was fleeting. Mr. Zuckerberg and other senior executives largely shelved the basic research, according to previously unreported internal documents and people familiar with the effort, and weakened or blocked efforts to apply its conclusions to Facebook products.\nFacebook policy chief Joel Kaplan, who played a central role in vetting proposed changes, argued at the time that efforts to make conversations on the platform more civil were “paternalistic,” said people familiar with his comments.\nAnother concern, they and others said, was that some proposed changes would have disproportionately affected conservative users and publishers, at a time when the company faced accusations from the right of political bias.\nFacebook revealed few details about the effort and has divulged little about what became of it. In 2020, the questions the effort sought to address are even more acute, as a charged presidential election looms and Facebook has been a conduit for conspiracy theories and partisan sparring about the coronavirus pandemic.\nIn essence, Facebook is under fire for making the world more divided. Many of its own experts appeared to agree—and to believe Facebook could mitigate many of the problems. The company chose not to.\nMr. Kaplan in a recent interview said he and other executives had approved certain changes meant to improve civic discussion. In other cases where proposals were blocked, he said, he was trying to “instill some discipline, rigor and responsibility into the process” as he vetted the effectiveness and potential unintended consequences of changes to how the platform operated.\nInternally, the vetting process earned a nickname: “Eat Your Veggies.”\nAmericans were drifting apart on fundamental societal issues well before the creation of social media, decades of Pew Research Center surveys have shown. But 60% of Americans think the country’s biggest tech companies are helping further divide the country, while only 11% believe they are uniting it, according to a Gallup-Knight survey in March.\nAt Facebook, “There was this soul-searching period after 2016 that seemed to me this period of really sincere, ‘Oh man, what if we really did mess up the world?’ ” said Eli Pariser, co-director of Civic Signals, a project that aims to build healthier digital spaces, and who has spoken to Facebook officials about polarization.\nMr. Pariser said that started to change after March 2018, when Facebook got in hot water after disclosing that Cambridge Analytica, the political-analytics startup, improperly obtained Facebook data about tens of millions of people. The shift has gained momentum since, he said: “The internal pendulum swung really hard to ‘the media hates us no matter what we do, so let’s just batten down the hatches.’ ”\nIn a sign of how far the company has moved, Mr. Zuckerberg in January said he would stand up “against those who say that new types of communities forming on social media are dividing us.” People who have heard him speak privately said he argues social media bears little responsibility for polarization.\nHe argues the platform is in fact a guardian of free speech, even when the content is objectionable—a position that drove Facebook’s decision not to fact-check political advertising ahead of the 2020 election.\n‘INTEGRITY TEAMS’\nFacebook launched its research on divisive content and behavior at a moment when it was grappling with whether its mission to “connect the world” was good for society.\nFixing the polarization problem would be difficult, requiring Facebook to rethink some of its core products. Most notably, the project forced Facebook to consider how it prioritized “user engagement”—a metric involving time spent, likes, shares and comments that for years had been the lodestar of its system.\nChampioned by Chris Cox, Facebook’s chief product officer at the time and a top deputy to Mr. Zuckerberg, the work was carried out over much of 2017 and 2018 by engineers and researchers assigned to a cross-jurisdictional task force dubbed “Common Ground” and employees in newly created “Integrity Teams” embedded around the company.\nEven before the teams’ 2017 creation, Facebook researchers had found signs of trouble. A 2016 presentation that names as author a Facebook researcher and sociologist, Monica Lee, found extremist content thriving in more than one-third of large German political groups on the platform. Swamped with racist, conspiracy-minded and pro-Russian content, the groups were disproportionately influenced by a subset of hyperactive users, the presentation notes. Most of them were private or secret.\nThe high number of extremist groups was concerning, the presentation says. Worse was Facebook’s realization that its algorithms were responsible for their growth. The 2016 presentation states that “64% of all extremist group joins are due to our recommendation tools” and that most of the activity came from the platform’s “Groups You Should Join” and “Discover” algorithms: “Our recommendation systems grow the problem.”\nMs. Lee, who remains at Facebook, didn’t respond to inquiries. Facebook declined to respond to questions about how it addressed the problem in the presentation, which other employees said weren’t unique to Germany or the Groups product. In a presentation at an international security conference in February, Mr. Zuckerberg said the company tries not to recommend groups that break its rules or are polarizing.\n“We’ve learned a lot since 2016 and are not the same company today,” a Facebook spokeswoman said. “We’ve built a robust integrity team, strengthened our policies and practices to limit harmful content, and used research to understand our platform’s impact on society so we continue to improve.” Facebook in February announced $2 million in funding for independent research proposals on polarization.\nThe Common Ground team sought to tackle the polarization problem directly, said people familiar with the team. Data scientists involved with the effort found some interest groups—often hobby-based groups with no explicit ideological alignment—brought people from different backgrounds together constructively. Other groups appeared to incubate impulses to fight, spread falsehoods or demonize a population of outsiders.\nIn keeping with Facebook’s commitment to neutrality, the teams decided Facebook shouldn’t police people’s opinions, stop conflict on the platform, or prevent people from forming communities. The vilification of one’s opponents was the problem, according to one internal document from the team.\n“We’re explicitly not going to build products that attempt to change people’s beliefs,” one 2018 document states. “We’re focused on products that increase empathy, understanding, and humanization of the ‘other side.’ ”\nHOT-BUTTON ISSUES\nOne proposal sought to salvage conversations in groups derailed by hot-button issues, according to the people familiar with the team and internal documents. If two members of a Facebook group devoted to parenting fought about vaccinations, the moderators could establish a temporary subgroup to host the argument or limit the frequency of posting on the topic to avoid a public flame war.\nAnother idea, documents show, was to tweak recommendation algorithms to suggest a wider range of Facebook groups than people would ordinarily encounter.\nBuilding these features and combating polarization might come at a cost of lower engagement, the Common Ground team warned in a mid-2018 document, describing some of its own proposals as “antigrowth” and requiring Facebook to “take a moral stance.”\nTaking action would require Facebook to form partnerships with academics and nonprofits to give credibility to changes affecting public conversation, the document says. This was becoming difficult as the company slogged through controversies after the 2016 presidential election.\n“People don’t trust us,” said a presentation created in the summer of 2018.\nThe engineers and data scientists on Facebook’s Integrity Teams—chief among them, scientists who worked on newsfeed, the stream of posts and photos that greet users when they visit Facebook—arrived at the polarization problem indirectly, according to people familiar with the teams. Asked to combat fake news, spam, clickbait and inauthentic users, the employees looked for ways to diminish the reach of such ills. One early discovery: Bad behavior came disproportionately from a small pool of hyperpartisan users.\nA second finding in the U.S. saw a larger infrastructure of accounts and publishers on the far right than on the far left. Outside observers were documenting the same phenomenon. The gap meant even seemingly apolitical actions such as reducing the spread of clickbait headlines—along the lines of “You Won’t Believe What Happened Next”—affected conservative speech more than liberal content in aggregate.\nThat was a tough sell to Mr. Kaplan, said people who heard him discuss Common Ground and Integrity proposals. A former deputy chief of staff to George W. Bush, Mr. Kaplan became more involved in content-ranking decisions after 2016 allegations Facebook had suppressed trending news stories from conservative outlets. An internal review didn’t substantiate the claims of bias, Facebook’s then-general counsel Colin Stretch told Congress, but the damage to Facebook’s reputation among conservatives had been done.\nEvery significant new integrity-ranking initiative had to seek the approval of not just engineering managers but also representatives of the public policy, legal, marketing and public-relations departments.\nLindsey Shepard, a former Facebook product-marketing director who helped set up the Eat Your Veggies process, said it arose from what she believed were reasonable concerns that overzealous engineers might let their politics influence the platform.\n“Engineers that were used to having autonomy maybe over-rotated a bit” after the 2016 election to address Facebook’s perceived flaws, she said. The meetings helped keep that in check. “At the end of the day, if we didn’t reach consensus, we’d frame up the different points of view, and then they’d be raised up to Mark.”\nSCUTTLED PROJECTS\nDisapproval from Mr. Kaplan’s team or Facebook’s communications department could scuttle a project, said people familiar with the effort. Negative policy-team reviews killed efforts to build a classification system for hyperpolarized content. Likewise, the Eat Your Veggies process shut down efforts to suppress clickbait about politics more than on other topics.\nInitiatives that survived were often weakened. Mr. Cox wooed Carlos Gomez Uribe, former head of Netflix Inc.’s recommendation system, to lead the newsfeed Integrity Team in January 2017. Within a few months, Mr. Uribe began pushing to reduce the outsize impact hyperactive users had.\nUnder Facebook’s engagement-based metrics, a user who likes, shares or comments on 1,500 pieces of content has more influence on the platform and its algorithms than one who interacts with just 15 posts, allowing “super-sharers” to drown out less-active users. Accounts with hyperactive engagement were far more partisan on average than normal Facebook users, and they were more likely to behave suspiciously, sometimes appearing on the platform as much as 20 hours a day and engaging in spam-like behavior. The behavior suggested some were either people working in shifts or bots.\nOne proposal Mr. Uribe’s team championed, called “Sparing Sharing,” would have reduced the spread of content disproportionately favored by hyperactive users, according to people familiar with it. Its effects would be heaviest on content favored by users on the far right and left. Middle-of-the-road users would gain influence.\nMr. Uribe called it “the happy face,” said some of the people. Facebook’s data scientists believed it could bolster the platform’s defenses against spam and coordinated manipulation efforts of the sort Russia undertook during the 2016 election.\nMr. Kaplan and other senior Facebook executives pushed back on the grounds it might harm a hypothetical Girl Scout troop, said people familiar with his comments. Suppose, Mr. Kaplan asked them, that the girls became Facebook super-sharers to promote cookies? Mitigating the reach of the platform’s most dedicated users would unfairly thwart them, he said.\nMr. Kaplan in the recent interview said he didn’t remember raising the Girl Scout example but was concerned about the effect on publishers who happened to have enthusiastic followings.\nThe debate got kicked up to Mr. Zuckerberg, who heard out both sides in a short meeting, said people briefed on it. His response: Do it, but cut the weighting by 80%. Mr. Zuckerberg also signaled he was losing interest in the effort to recalibrate the platform in the name of social good, they said, asking that they not bring him something like that again.\nMr. Uribe left Facebook and the tech industry within the year. He declined to discuss his work at Facebook in detail but confirmed his advocacy for the Sparing Sharing proposal. He said he left Facebook because of his frustration with company executives and their narrow focus on how integrity changes would affect American politics. While proposals like his did disproportionately affect conservatives in the U.S., he said, in other countries the opposite was true.\nOther projects met Sparing Sharing’s fate: weakened, not killed. Partial victories included efforts to promote news stories garnering engagement from a broad user base, not just partisans, and penalties for publishers that repeatedly shared false news or directed users to ad-choked pages.\nThe tug of war was resolved in part by the growing furor over the Cambridge Analytica scandal. In a September 2018 reorganization of Facebook’s newsfeed team, managers told employees the company’s priorities were shifting “away from societal good to individual value,” said people present for the discussion. If users wanted to routinely view or post hostile content about groups they didn’t like, Facebook wouldn’t suppress it if the content didn’t specifically violate the company’s rules.\nMr. Cox left the company several months later after disagreements regarding Facebook’s pivot toward private encrypted messaging. He hadn’t won most fights he had engaged in on integrity ranking and Common Ground product changes, people involved in the effort said, and his departure left the remaining staffers working on such projects without a high-level advocate.\nThe Common Ground team disbanded. The Integrity Teams still exist, though many senior staffers left the company or headed to Facebook’s Instagram platform.\nMr. Zuckerberg announced in 2019 that Facebook would take down content violating specific standards but where possible take a hands-off approach to policing material not clearly violating its standards.\n“You can’t impose tolerance top-down,” he said in an October speech at Georgetown University. “It has to come from people opening up, sharing experiences, and developing a shared story for society that we all feel we’re a part of. That’s how we make progress together.”\nWrite to Jeff Horwitz at Jeff.Horwitz@wsj.com and Deepa Seetharaman at Deepa.Seetharaman@wsj.com\nUncertain Times Call \n for Trusted Facts","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Seetharaman","given":"Jeff Horwitz and Deepa"}],"container-title":"Wall Street Journal","ISSN":"0099-9660","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,26]]},"language":"en-US","section":"Tech","source":"www.wsj.com","title":"Facebook Executives Shut Down Efforts to Make the Site Less Divisive","type":"article-newspaper","URL":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-it-encourages-division-top-executives-nixed-solutions-11590507499"},

Beginning with an analysis of civic republican theory, he notes that it promises greater citizen involvement in political decisionmaking, yet at the same time threatens to increase government power. Professor Seidenfeld finds that the current regime of administrative law neither allows for the full realization of civic republicanism's potential nor guards adequately against its dangers.

  {"id":"selfAmericanBabylonRace2005","abstract":"As the birthplace of the Black Panthers and a nationwide tax revolt, California embodied a crucial motif of the postwar United States: the rise of suburbs and the decline of cities, a process in which black and white histories inextricably joined. American Babylon tells this story through Oakland and its nearby suburbs, tracing both the history of civil rights and black power politics as well as the history of suburbanization and home-owner politics. Robert Self shows that racial inequities in both New Deal and Great Society liberalism precipitated local struggles over land, jobs, taxes, and race within postwar metropolitan development. Black power and the tax revolt evolved together, in tension. American Babylon demonstrates that the history of civil rights and black liberation politics in California did not follow a southern model, but represented a long-term struggle for economic rights that began during the World War II years and continued through the rise of the Black Panthers in the late 1960s. This struggle yielded a wide-ranging and profound critique of postwar metropolitan development and its foundation of class and racial segregation. Self traces the roots of the 1978 tax revolt to the 1940s, when home owners, real estate brokers, and the federal government used racial segregation and industrial property taxes to forge a middle-class lifestyle centered on property ownership. Using the East Bay as a starting point, Robert Self gives us a richly detailed, engaging narrative that uniquely integrates the most important racial liberation struggles and class politics of postwar America.","author":[{"family":"Self","given":"Robert O."}],"ISBN":"978-0-691-12486-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,8,28]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"405","publisher":"Princeton University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"American Babylon: Race and the Struggle for Postwar Oakland","title-short":"American Babylon","type":"book"},

  {"id":"seoAntinomiesAutomobileNew2013","abstract":"In the twentieth century, the antinomy of freedom and coercion served as the dominant paradigm for understanding issues of crime and punishment. Roscoe Pound in Criminal Justice in America (1930) and Herbert Packer in The Limits of the Criminal Sanction (1968) described a tension between the values of individual liberty and general security to explain the problems with the justice system and the public's disagreements over their solution. Historians of twentieth-century criminal law have also adopted this framework to explain causation and change. This essay argues that an antinomic perspective of criminal justice history, while useful, has obscured important historical questions. A focus on social changes, such as the transformations that the automobile brought about in the commission of crimes and police practices, instead of on contrasting values, offers a different account of how proceduralism became inextricably tied to notions of American freedom in the twentieth century. This approach also historicizes the “paradigm of antinomies” and shows how people in the past, like Pound and Packer, mobilized dualistic thinking, which shaped a criminal legal culture based on an antagonism—both real and perceived—between citizens and law enforcement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Seo","given":"Sarah A."}],"container-title":"Law & Social Inquiry","DOI":"10.1111/lsi.12047","ISSN":"0897-6546, 1747-4469","issue":"4","issued":{"literal":"2013/ed"},"language":"en","page":"1019-1040","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Antinomies and the Automobile: A New Approach to Criminal Justice Histories","title-short":"Antinomies and the Automobile","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/law-and-social-inquiry/article/antinomies-and-the-automobile-a-new-approach-to-criminal-justice-histories/D8946B4E18952CEF61444E5676DD4801","volume":"38"},

Results show that for 2011–2014, but not before, press freedom homophily is significantly predictive of the presence (or absence) of country-to-country Internet connections even when controlling for geographic proximity, bandwidth, and whether or not a country is democratic. The regime type variable was a significant predictor in 2002–2004 but not after. The findings provide insights into changes in press freedom around the world and the global Internet structure.

  {"id":"sewellVileVigilanceIntegrated2016","abstract":"The family is the principal source of socialization and protection against racism for many Blacks. Transmitting values, norms, morals, and beliefs (i.e., racial socialization) to successive generations is done to promote racial awareness and to prepare an individual to survive in racist environments. Further, developing a sense of security, resiliency, and cultural pride provides psychological protection against racial prejudice and discrimination. Protective socialization is even more critical when it becomes the difference between life and death at the hands of law enforcement—a fate faced by too many Black males as a result of racist policing practices, including the over-patrolling of Black communities. Because discriminatory surveillance and over-patrolling can incite a number of social, physical, and mental health issues, a holistic approach to understanding the interaction between Blacks and law enforcement is critical. This article reviews the Mundane Extreme Environmental Stress (MEES) model, racial socialization theory, and Family Stress Model in the development of a theoretical framework for understanding the patterns of interactions between Blacks and law enforcement, the immediate and long-term effects of unjustified shootings on Black families and communities, and the response of sociopolitical systems. The new theoretical framework will be used to inform the work of human service providers and practitioners by identifying targets for interventions to improve relations and trust between Black communities and law enforcement institutions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Sewell","given":"Whitney"},{"family":"Horsford","given":"Christina E."},{"family":"Coleman","given":"Kanisha"},{"family":"Watkins","given":"Charity S."}],"container-title":"Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment","DOI":"10.1080/10911359.2015.1127735","ISSN":"1091-1359","issue":"3-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,5,18]]},"page":"287-302","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Vile vigilance: An integrated theoretical framework for understanding the state of Black surveillance","title-short":"Vile vigilance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10911359.2015.1127735","volume":"26"},
  {"id":"shackelfordFutureFrontiers2019","abstract":"Many leading environmental and security concerns now facing the international community may be traced to the frontiers, that is, the areas historically outside of national jurisdiction including the deep seabed, outer space, Antarctica, the atmosphere, and some argue, cyberspace. From climate change and cyber attacks to the associated challenges of space weaponization and orbital debris mitigation, solutions to all of these issues have at their root some form of regulation over the frontiers, sometimes — though not always accurately — called the “global commons.” Yet the amorphous legal concept of the common heritage of mankind (CHM) that has in part governed some of these spaces since the 1960s is increasingly under stress. Governance is transitioning away from consensual United Nations-centered multilateral treaties to regional and bilateral accords. These burgeoning regime complexes are being influenced by the multipolar state of international relations, advancing technology, and resource scarcity. Environmental and security challenges are proliferating as a result of governance being in flux. This Article makes an original contribution by comparing and contrasting some of the principal issues facing these frontiers of the international community, analyzing how and why existing governance structures are often failing to adequately meet global collective action problems with special coverage on cybersecurity and Internet governance, and proposing a new way forward incorporating lessons from successful regimes as well as the interdisciplinary scholarship on polycentric governance. Multi-stakeholder collaboration is imperative in order to avoid tragedies of the global commons. But this requires recognizing the realities of international relations and crafting nimble twenty-first century governance structures that are both responsive to the titanic geopolitical and technological changes underway, and that promote sustainable development and cyber peace.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Shackelford","given":"Scott"}],"DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.3318521","event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,18]]},"language":"en","number":"ID 3318521","publisher":"Social Science Research Network","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"papers.ssrn.com","title":"The Future of Frontiers","type":"report","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3318521"},

  {"id":"shackelfordHaveYouUpdated2018","abstract":"There is a great deal of buzz surrounding the Internet of Things (IoT), which is the notion, simply put, that nearly everything not currently connected to the Internet from gym shorts to streetlights soon will be. The rise of “smart products” such as Internet-enabled refrigerators and self-driving cars holds the promise to revolutionize business and society. To substantiate the coming wave, Samsung has announced that all of its products would be connected to the Internet by 2020. Yet it is an open question whether security can or will scale along with this increasingly crowded field, or whether a combination of perverse incentives, increasing complexity, new problems, and new impacts of old problems like “technical debt” amassing from products being rushed to market, will derail progress and exacerbate cyber insecurity. This Article investigates contemporary approaches to IoT security through an in-depth comparative case study focusing on the European Union and the United States. Particular attention is paid to the impact of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Network Information Security (NIS) Directive in the EU, and influence of the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework, and other leading standards, on IoT security with a focus on mitigating the risk of politically motivated attacks. We analyze transatlantic reform proposals — including the U.S. Internet of Things (IoT) Cybersecurity Improvement Act of 2017 and the potential for a dedicated NIST Framework for IoT security given the international success of the NIST CSF — and argue for a polycentric approach to boosting IoT securing across both jurisdictions by applying lessons from major Internet governance debates.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Shackelford","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Bradner","given":"Scott O."}],"event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,4]]},"language":"en","number":"ID 3208018","publisher":"Social Science Research Network","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"papers.ssrn.com","title":"Have You Updated Your Toaster?

Does it still make sense — as it did in 1998 when it was created — for a non-profit corporation based in California to be responsible for managing the Domain Name System (DNS), which matches IP addresses with website names?  Would your answer change if you were a resident of New Delhi, or Beijing?  From net neutrality to privacy, encryption, and the proper role for governments in securing critical infrastructure, Internet governance is a multi-faceted field with an increasing number of power centers shaping myriad global cybersecurity debates.  Recently, in the wake of the 2015-16 Apple encryption debate touched off by the FBI’s request to unlock the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters, the role of the private sector vis-à-vis States has enjoyed renewed attention at a time when the prevailing multi-stakeholder approach – incorporating a variety of non-governmental actors in an open and participative polycentric governance process – has come under strain.  This reexamination is a continuation of the global debate following revelations by former NSA-contractor Edward Snowden, prompting a reassessment of the benefits and drawbacks of the current state of Internet governance and what role international law and institutions should play in crafting twenty-first century cyberspace.  This Article delves into this debate by focusing on the Apple encryption saga and what it portends for the role of emerging private and public power centers in shaping the future of polycentric Internet governance.  Addressing this question and what it portends for the prospects of cyber peace in an age often defined by cyber insecurity is central to enhancing global equity, security, and privacy online.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Shackelford","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Richards","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Raymond","given":"Anjanette"},{"family":"Kerr","given":"Jackie"},{"family":"Kuehn","given":"Andreas"}],"event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,11]]},"language":"en","number":"ID 2851283","publisher":"Social Science Research Network","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"papers.ssrn.com","title":"iGovernance: The Future of Multi-Stakeholder Internet Governance in the Wake of the Apple Encryption Saga","title-short":"iGovernance","type":"report","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2851283"},
  {"id":"shackelfordUnpackingRiseBenefit2019","abstract":"The increasing interest being in social entrepreneurship has brought with it the beginnings of a legal revolution in the way that firms are incorporated and managed with thirty-three states having enacted statues permitting the formation of special corporate entities known as benefit corporations. These businesses are required to pursue a public benefit or community purpose while still earning a profit for their shareholders. Yet not all benefit corporation statutes are created equal. Varying top-down and bottom-up approaches were taken to enact these laws, which may contribute to different success rates in terms of the number of benefit corporations created in the preceding years. In order to identify governance best practices that could inform other states and nations debating similar legislation, this article analyzes the different ways that the benefit corporation statutes were created in Virginia, Connecticut, and Delaware. This process of adoption and resulting incorporation of entities is then compared to the European Union’s efforts at regulating social entrepreneurship, with a particular focus on the UK’s Community Interest Company Approach. Through this lens, the Article investigates the processes and supporters of benefit corporation statutes, and compares theses with EU efforts to support social enterprises, in order to better understand how experimentation with legally unique forms of business contribute to current efforts to modify the relationship between business and society.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Shackelford","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Hiller","given":"Janine S."},{"family":"Ma","given":"Xiao"}],"DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.3326852","event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,31]]},"language":"en","number":"ID 3326852","publisher":"Social Science Research Network","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"papers.ssrn.com","title":"Unpacking the Rise of Benefit Corporations: A Transatlantic Comparative Case Study","title-short":"Unpacking the Rise of Benefit Corporations","type":"report","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3326852"},

  {"id":"shadmyNEWSOCIALCONTRACT","abstract":"Digital platforms have an ever-growing ability to control and regulate their users. The platforms' terms of service, content moderation policies, and algorithms form new regulatory ecosystems. These new ecosystems, this Article argues, do more than simply establish sets of affordances and constraints; rather, they challenge and transform basic legal concepts. To demonstrate this argument, this Article analyzes Facebook's design, technology, and rhetoric. The analysis shows that Facebook's infrastructure creates and promotes a novel regime of rights. Rights, under this regime, protect the freedom to feel instead of the freedom to choose. They do not generate any duties-not on the fellow users, and certainly not on the platform itself, which is not accountable to, or limited by, the users' rights. This regime of rights, unlike traditional ones, does not function through discourse and interpretation, but through code. Thus, as this Article reveals, digital platforms go beyond adding a digital layer to our personal, professional, and political relations: they also add a normative and legal layer, and shape new social contracts. Alarmingly, for the most part, users seem unaware of this normative aspect.","author":[{"family":"Shadmy","given":"Tomer"}],"language":"en","page":"49","source":"Zotero","title":"THE NEW SOCIAL CONTRACT: FACEBOOK'S COMMUNITY AND OUR RIGHTS","type":"article-journal"},

However, because crowdwork is temporary, large-scale, distributed, and mediated, its governance remains a challenge that often casts a shadow over its strategic value. The objective of this paper is to shed light on the making of value-adding crowdwork arrangements. Specifically, the paper explores crowdwork platform governance mechanisms and the relationships between these mechanisms and organizational value creation. Building on a comprehensive review of the extant literature on governance and crowdwork, we construct an overarching conceptual model that integrates control system and coordination system as two complementary mechanisms that drive crowdwork platform governance effectiveness and the consequent job provider benefits. Furthermore, the model accentuates the role of the degree of centralization and the degree of routinization as critical moderators in crowdwork platform governance. Overall, the paper highlights the potential of crowdwork to contribute not only to inclusion, fair wages and flexible work arrangements for workers but also to organizations’ value and competitive edge.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Shafiei Gol","given":"Elham"},{"family":"Stein","given":"Mari-Klara"},{"family":"Avital","given":"Michel"}],"collection-title":"SI: Review issue","container-title":"The Journal of Strategic Information Systems","container-title-short":"The Journal of Strategic Information Systems","DOI":"10.1016/j.jsis.2019.01.001","ISSN":"0963-8687","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"175-195","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Crowdwork platform governance toward organizational value creation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963868717302445","volume":"28"},

The construction of such systems involves many distributed design choices. The end products (e.g., recommendation systems, medical analysis tools, real-time game engines, speech recognizers) thus involve many tunable configuration parameters. These parameters are often specified and hard-coded into the software by various developers or teams. If optimized jointly, these parameters can result in significant improvements. Bayesian optimization is a powerful tool for the joint optimization of design choices that is gaining great popularity in recent years.

How do the spread of misinformation and fact-checking compete? What are the structural and dynamic characteristics of the core of the misinformation diffusion network, and who are its main purveyors? How to reduce the overall amount of misinformation? To explore these questions we built Hoaxy, an open platform that enables large-scale, systematic studies of how misinformation and fact-checking spread and compete on Twitter. Hoaxy captures public tweets that include links to articles from low-credibility and fact-checking sources. We perform k-core decomposition on a diffusion network obtained from two million retweets produced by several hundred thousand accounts over the six months before the election. As we move from the periphery to the core of the network, fact-checking nearly disappears, while social bots proliferate. The number of users in the main core reaches equilibrium around the time of the election, with limited churn and increasingly dense connections. We conclude by quantifying how effectively the network can be disrupted by penalizing the most central nodes. These findings provide a first look at the anatomy of a massive online misinformation diffusion network.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Shao","given":"Chengcheng"},{"family":"Hui","given":"Pik-Mai"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Xinwen"},{"family":"Flammini","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Menczer","given":"Filippo"},{"family":"Ciampaglia","given":"Giovanni Luca"}],"container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0196087","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,4,27]]},"language":"en","page":"e0196087","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Anatomy of an online misinformation network","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196087","volume":"13"},

As the framework shows, these organisations are subject to multiple influences and demands. There is a need for more and different reporting than is the norm under the private sector's decision-useful reporting framework. Although the framework focuses on what Mulgan (2000) describes as the core of accountability, it is not only a financial reporting framework but it also seeks to make concrete Kamuf's (2007) argument that accountability might include accounting through narrative as well as the prevailing numeric evaluation. The paper stresses the need for information to be accessible to the public, and in particular argues that a stream of information between the public and private sector partners needs to be developed and disseminated to achieve accountability for public money that is increasingly spent in the private sector.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Shaoul","given":"Jean"},{"family":"Stafford","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Stapleton","given":"Pamela"}],"collection-title":"Accounterability Special Issue for CPA","container-title":"Critical Perspectives on Accounting","container-title-short":"Critical Perspectives on Accounting","DOI":"10.1016/j.cpa.2011.12.006","ISSN":"1045-2354","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"213-229","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Accountability and corporate governance of public private partnerships","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1045235411001729","volume":"23"},
  {"id":"shapiroClimateChangeYouTube2018","abstract":"YouTube videos are a ubiquitous source of information but also a venue for users to comment on discussion boards that addend videos. There are no moderators of these discussions, and thus there is a possibility for self-appointed leaders to emerge, responding incessantly and across a genre of videos. These “elites,” as they are labelled here, use the discussion as a personal campaign tool, diminishing the deliberative potential of provocative topics. To determine whether this is happening and to complement existing research analyzing the content of comments, this paper focuses on the structure of the discussions that follow the most popular climate change-related videos. Network analysis confirms that discussions can be elite-driven, appearing in two different network structure types. Among the core group of elite commenters, most are either climate change activists or sceptics, and the most prolific commenters among this core group are activists.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Shapiro","given":"Matthew A."},{"family":"Park","given":"Han Woo"}],"container-title":"Environmental Communication","DOI":"10.1080/17524032.2017.1289108","ISSN":"1752-4032","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,2]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/17524032.2017.1289108","page":"115-131","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Climate Change and YouTube: Deliberation Potential in Post-video Discussions","title-short":"Climate Change and YouTube","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/17524032.2017.1289108","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"shapiroOwlMinervaColors1977","abstract":"Gary Shapiro THE OWL OF MINERVA AND THE COLORS OF THE NIGHT Hegel is known to many readers mainly for a few striking figurative passages which he himself excluded from the central structures of his major texts as extrinsic remarks. His mature system justifies this exclusion by claiming that philosophy operates in the realm of the pure concept, having surpassed the sensuous narrative images of art and religion. Nevertheless, the very forcefulness of the passages themselves indicates that the mature Hegel may never have peacefully aufgehoben the young man who believed in 1796 that philosophy, in order to resume its original role as educator of mankind, must become aesthetic, mythological, and poetic. (I am assuming that Hegel either wrote \"the earliest system-program of German idealism\" or endorsed its principles.) A reading of the famous elegiac passage in the \"Preface\" to the Philosophy of Right suggests not only problems of meaning, but of philosophical rhetoric: One more word about giving instruction as to what the world ought to be. Philosophy in any case always comes on the scene too late to give it. As the thought of the world, it appears only when actuality is already there cut and dried after its process of formation has been completed. The teaching of the concept, which is also history's inescapable lesson, is that it is only when actuality is mature that the ideal first appears over against the real and that the ideal apprehends this same real world in its substance and builds it up for itself into the shape of an intellectual realm. When philosophy paints its gray in gray, then has a shape of life grown old. By philosophy's gray in gray it cannot be rejuvenated but only understood. The owl of Minerva spreads its wings only with the falling of the dusk.1 The first focus of attention here is usually on the mood of philosophical resignation in which completion of a rational development leaves no room for action or advice. Theory must necessarily give up any Utopian 276 Gary Shapiro277 or activist pretentions it may have harbored once it sees that it can only describe what has been. Despite the fact that Hegelian actuality (Wirklichkeit) is the result of a rational and dialectical process, ascetic renunciation of any relation to action puts Hegel in the strange company of nineteenth century positivists and empiricists; it also establishes a tone fundamentally different from classical European political philosophy of thinkers like Machiavelli, Hobbes, and Rousseau, a tone which Marx, provoked by Hegel, was to revive. The statement can also be read on a scale much larger than the political, in which it suggests a resigned acceptance of the completion of Western philosophy and civilization. Hegel is notorious for his view that spirit (Geist), the fundamental reality, has completed itself through the self-knowledge which it attains in his system of philosophy. That he sometimes speaks of his enterprise as a Wissen or Wissenschaft (knowledge, science, or wisdom) suggests how far he has come from the Socratic conception of philosophy as always characterized by a lack of that which it loves. It would be intriguing to explore these themes. Such exploration would involve a more thorough knowledge of what Hegel understands by end, completion, and fulfillment when he speaks of political life and the higher forms of spirit—art, religion, and philosophy. We might even be led by such an inquiry into Hegel's meaning to see his claims as historically and philosophically plausible and to reconsider our own resistance to believing that we live in a deepening twilight. What I wish to do, however, is to call attention to the manner in which Hegel speaks of Minerva's owl and to juxtapose both the manner and the substance of his thought about the twilight of philosophy and civilization with some of Hölderlin's dichterisch and Heidegger's denkerisch meditations on similar themes. For if Hegel has announced the coming of the night, Hölderlin and Heidegger have sought to make the night their very own territory and to comprehend it from within. If Hegel has rather gingerly allowed himself to lapse into that famous figurative discourse of the...","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Shapiro","given":"Gary"}],"container-title":"Philosophy and Literature","DOI":"10.1353/phl.1977.0005","ISSN":"1086-329X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[1977]]},"language":"en","page":"276-294","source":"Project MUSE","title":"The Owl of Minerva and the Colors of the Night","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://muse.jhu.edu/article/415542/summary","volume":"1"},

Giving an in-depth account of the structure of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the details of the petition procedures, Shelton explores the issues of legitimacy, transparency, effectiveness, and efficiency raised by various aspects of the petitioning process, and discusses the various ways in which these issues in the petition process contribute to the broader crisis of the system's authority.

Recent research demonstrates that evaluations can be influenced by factors other than teaching ability such as student characteristics and the physical environment. In this study, it was predicted that students' perception of the lecturer would significantly predict teaching effectiveness ratings. Using an 11-item student rating scale (N = 199), a two-factor confirmatory factor model of teaching effectiveness was specified and estimated using LISREL8; the factors were 'lecturer ability' and 'module attributes'. This initial model was extended to include a factor relating to the students' ratings of the lecturer's charisma. The model was an acceptable description of the data. The charisma factor explained 69% and 37% of the variation in the 'lecturer ability and 'module attributes' factors respectively. These findings suggest that student ratings do not wholly reflect actual teaching effectiveness. It is argued that a central trait exists which influences a student's evaluation of the lecturer.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Shevlin","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Banyard","given":"Philip"},{"family":"Davies","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Griffiths","given":"Mark"}],"container-title":"Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education","DOI":"10.1080/713611436","ISSN":"0260-2938","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000,12,1]]},"page":"397-405","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The Validity of Student Evaluation of Teaching in Higher Education: Love me, love my lectures?","title-short":"The Validity of Student Evaluation of Teaching in Higher Education","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/713611436","volume":"25"},

On the other hand, those who are accustomed to an online echo chamber subsequently polarize when faced with an outgroup audience.

However, social media also enables the wide propagation of \"fake news,\" i.e., news with intentionally false information. Fake news on social media can have significant negative societal effects. Therefore, fake news detection on social media has recently become an emerging research area that is attracting tremendous attention. This book, from a data mining perspective, introduces the basic concepts and characteristics of fake news across disciplines, reviews representative fake news detection methods in a principled way, and illustrates challenging issues of fake news detection on social media. In particular, we discussed the value of news content and social context, and important extensions to handle early detection, weakly-supervised detection, and explainable detection. The concepts, algorithms, and methods described in this lecture can help harness the power of social media to build effective and intelligent fake news detection systems. This book is an accessible introduction to the study of detecting fake news on social media.

There is no one “true” meaning of human dignity, but rather different levels of ”thickness” and ”thinness” that are culturally determined in each society.

Nisbet was a trained lawyer who had served on the Georgia Supreme Court, and his legal training shaped the way that he viewed secession. He believed that the Constitution did not give states the right to dissolve the Union; instead, this power rested solely in the people, and he framed the resolution and ordinance accordingly.

  {"id":"simonThirdViewBlack2004","abstract":"This Article presents a novel body of research in cognitive psychology called coherence-based reasoning, which has thus far been published in journals of experimental psychology. This cognitive approach challenges the stalemated conflict between the Rationalist and Critical models of decision making that have dominated legal scholarship for over a century. The experimental findings demonstrate that many legal decisions fit into neither of these models. Based on a connectionist cognitive architecture, coherence-based reasoning shows that the decision-making process progresses bidirectionally: premises and facts both determine conclusions and are affected by them in return. A natural result of this cognitive process is a skewing of the premises and facts toward inflated support for the chosen decision. The Article applies this research to four important aspects of the trial. It argues that the current doctrine in these areas is based on misconceptions about human cognition, which lead to systematic legal errors. By identifying the cognitive phenomena that lie at the root of these failings, the research makes it possible to devise interventions and introduce procedures that reduce the risk of trial error.","author":[{"family":"Simon","given":"Dan"}],"container-title":"The University of Chicago Law Review","ISSN":"00419494","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004]]},"page":"511-586","title":"A Third View of the Black Box: Cognitive Coherence in Legal Decision Making","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1600674","volume":"71"},

The book shows how signaling games themselves evolve, and introduces a new model of learning with invention. The juxtaposition of atomic signals leads to complex signals, as the natural product of gradual process. Signals operate in networks of senders and receivers at all levels of life. Information is transmitted, but it is also processed in various ways. That is how we think — signals run around a very complicated signaling network. Signaling is a key ingredient in the evolution of teamwork, in the human but also in the animal world, even in micro-organisms. Communication and co-ordination of action are different aspects of the flow of information, and are both effected by signals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Skyrms","given":"Brian"}],"ISBN":"978-0-19-172276-9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,4,8]]},"language":"en_US","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"www.oxfordscholarship.com","title":"Signals: Evolution, Learning, and Information","title-short":"Signals","type":"book","URL":"https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199580828.001.0001/acprof-9780199580828"},

  {"id":"smileyBruteThugDemonization2016","abstract":"The synonymy of Blackness with criminality is not a new phenomenon in America. Documented historical accounts have shown how myths, stereotypes, and racist ideologies led to discriminatory policies and court rulings that fueled racial violence in the post-Reconstruction era and have culminated in the exponential increase of Black male incarceration today. Misconceptions and prejudices manufactured and disseminated through various channels such as the media included references to a “brute” image of Black males. In the 21st century, this negative imagery of Black males has frequently utilized the negative connotation of the terminology “thug.” In recent years, law enforcement agencies have unreasonably used deadly force on Black males allegedly considered to be “suspects” or “persons of interest.” The exploitation of these often-targeted victims’ criminal records, physical appearances, or misperceived attributes has been used to justify their unlawful deaths. Despite the connection between disproportionate criminality and Black masculinity, little research has been done on how unarmed Black male victims, particularly but not exclusively at the hands of law enforcement, have been posthumously criminalized. This article investigates the historical criminalization of Black males and its connection to contemporary unarmed victims of law enforcement. Action research methodology in the data collection process is utilized to interpret how Black male victims are portrayed by traditional mass media, particularly through the use of language, in ways that marginalize and devictimize these individuals. This study also aims to elucidate a contemporary understanding of race relations, racism, and the plight of the Black male in a 21-century “postracial” America.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Smiley","given":"CalvinJohn"},{"family":"Fakunle","given":"David"}],"container-title":"Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment","DOI":"10.1080/10911359.2015.1129256","ISSN":"1091-1359","issue":"3-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,5,18]]},"page":"350-366","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"From “brute” to “thug:” The demonization and criminalization of unarmed Black male victims in America","title-short":"From “brute” to “thug","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10911359.2015.1129256","volume":"26"},

Respondents experienced racial microaggressions in three domains: (a) campus—academic, (b) campus—social, and (c) campus—public spaces. Black males are stereotyped and placed under increased surveillance by community and local policing tactics on and off campus. Across these domains, Black males were defined as being “out of place” and “fitting the description” of illegitimate nonmembers of the campus community. Students reported psychological stress responses symptomatic of racial battle fatigue (e.g., frustration, shock, anger, disappointment, resentment, anxiety, helplessness, hopelessness, and fear).

  {"id":"smithCommunityAccountabilityMinority2003","abstract":"A growing body of evidence shows that minorities are disproportionately the targets of police brutality, but important theoretical questions about the causes of that inequity remain unanswered. One promising line of research involves structural-level analyses of the incidence of police brutality complaints; however, existing studies do not incorporate variables from alternative theoretical explanations. Drawing on the community accountability hypothesis and the threat hypothesis, we tested the predictions of two prominent structural-level explanations of police brutality in a study of civil rights criminal complaints. The study included cities of 150,000+ population (n = 114).

  {"id":"smithOpennessSocialPraxis2017","abstract":"Since the early 2000s, there has been an explosion in the usage of the term open, arguably stemming from the advent of networked technologies — including the Internet and mobile technologies. ‘Openness’ seems to be everywhere, and takes many forms: from open knowledge, open education, open data and open science, to open Internet, open medical records systems and open innovation. These applications of openness are having a profound, and sometimes transformative, effect on social, political and economic life.This explosion of the use of the term has led to multiple interpretations, ambiguities, and even misunderstandings, not to mention countless debates and disagreements over precise definitions. The paper “Fifty shades of open” by Pomerantz and Peek (2016) highlighted the increasing ambiguity and even confusion surrounding this term. This article builds on Pomerantz and Peek’s attempt to disambiguate the term by offering an alternative understanding to openness — that of social praxis. More specifically, our framing can be broken down into three social processes: open production, open distribution, and open consumption. Each process shares two traits that make them open: you don’t have to pay (free price), and anyone can participate (non-discrimination) in these processes.We argue that conceptualizing openness as social praxis offers several benefits. First, it provides a way out of a variety of problems that result from ambiguities and misunderstandings that emerge from the current multitude of uses of openness. Second, it provides a contextually sensitive understanding of openness that allows space for the many different ways openness is experienced — often very different from the way that more formal definitions conceptualize it. Third, it points us towards an approach to developing practice-specific theory that we believe helps us build generalizable knowledge on what works (or not), for whom, and in what contexts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Matthew Longshore"},{"family":"Seward","given":"Ruhiya"}],"container-title":"First Monday","DOI":"10.5210/fm.v22i4.7073","ISSN":"13960466","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,4,3]]},"language":"en","source":"journals.uic.edu","title":"Openness as social praxis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/7073","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"snyderCostEmptyThreats2011","abstract":"A large literature in political science takes for granted that democratic leaders would pay substantial domestic political costs for failing to carry out the public threats they make in international crises, and consequently that making threats substantially enhances their leverage in crisis bargaining. And yet proponents of this audience costs theory have presented very little evidence that this causal mechanism actually operates in real—as opposed to simulated—crises. We look for such evidence in post-1945 crises and find hardly any. Audience cost mechanisms are rare because (1) leaders see unambiguously committing threats as imprudent, (2) domestic audiences care more about policy substance than about consistency between the leader's words and deeds, (3) domestic audiences care about their country's reputation for resolve and national honor independent of whether the leader has issued an explicit threat, and (4) authoritarian targets of democratic threats do not perceive audience costs dynamics in the same way that audience costs theorists do. We found domestic audience costs as secondary mechanisms in a few cases where the public already had hawkish preferences before any threats were made.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Snyder","given":"Jack"},{"family":"Borghard","given":"Erica D."}],"container-title":"American Political Science Review","DOI":"10.1017/S000305541100027X","ISSN":"1537-5943, 0003-0554","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,8]]},"language":"en","page":"437-456","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"The Cost of Empty Threats: A Penny, Not a Pound","title-short":"The Cost of Empty Threats","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/cost-of-empty-threats-a-penny-not-a-pound/2E18EEFDB257556D4350AAFEE4EA3961","volume":"105"},

Then come back and show us how it is done.”\n\nAs has become characteristic of American politics, a media battle erupted in the wake of these remarks, conservatives and progressives alike inflamed with moral indignation. Many pundits and political figures condemned the comments as racist, xenophobic, and anti-American, while others defended them vociferously—describing critics as the true racists, shamelessly playing the victim for political benefit. While unbiased observers might have made a range of interpretations of the president’s original tweets, the subsequent chants of “Send her back!” that were left unchallenged at a Trump rally reduced the ambiguity of his missive. News of the chants fanned the fire on talk radio, on cable news analysis shows, and across social media, disturbing many in the US who have been made to feel disparaged or unwelcome at some point in their lives on the basis of their race, ethnicity, or national origin.","author":[{"family":"Sobieraj","given":"Sarah"}],"container-title":"MediaWell, Social Science Research Council","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,22]]},"language":"English","title":"Disinformation, Democracy, and the Social Costs of Identity-Based Attacks Online","type":"webpage","URL":"https://mediawell.ssrc.org/expert-reflections/disinformation-democracy-and-the-social-costs-of-identity-based-attacks-online/"},

Then the analysis concentrates on the type of changes to a confusion matrix that do not change a measure, therefore, preserve a classifier’s evaluation (measure invariance). The result is the measure invariance taxonomy with respect to all relevant label distribution changes in a classification problem.

Using public speeches and pamphlets of the US black freedom movement, and private documentation by movement activists, this paper demonstrates how black activists used the nascent anti-genocide norm to (1) critique the relationship between the US government’s role in the postwar international order amid ongoing mass violence against black Americans, and (2) express solidarity with global social movements against colonialism and Cold War-era imperialism.

Accordingly, we discuss the effects of such polarization on democracies, and start building a foundation for remedies.

  {"id":"songBoundaryProblemDemocratic2012","abstract":"Democracy is rule by the demos, but by what criteria is the demos constituted? Theorists of democracy have tended to assume that the demos is properly defined by national boundaries or by the territorial boundaries of the modern state. In a recent turn, many democratic theorists have advanced the principles of affected interests and coercion as the basis for defining the boundaries of democracy. According to these principles, it is not co-nationals or fellow citizens but all affected or all subjected to coercion who constitute the demos. In this paper, I argue that these recent approaches to the boundary problem are insufficiently attentive to the conditions of democracy. Democracy is not merely a set of procedures; it also consists of substantive values and principles. Political equality is a constitutive condition of democracy, and solidarity is an instrumental condition of democracy. The affected interests and coercion principles create serious problems for the realization of these conditions – problems of size and stability. Building on this critique, this paper presents democratic considerations for why the demos should be bounded by the territorial boundaries of the state, grounded in the state's role in (1) securing the constitutive conditions of democracy, (2) serving as the primary site of solidarity conducive to democratic participation, and (3) establishing clear links between representatives and their constituents. I examine and reject a third alternative, a global demos bounded by a world state, and conclude by considering some practical implications of my argument.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Song","given":"Sarah"}],"container-title":"International Theory","DOI":"10.1017/S1752971911000248","ISSN":"1752-9727, 1752-9719","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,3]]},"language":"en","page":"39-68","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"The boundary problem in democratic theory: why the demos should be bounded by the state","title-short":"The boundary problem in democratic theory","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-theory/article/boundary-problem-in-democratic-theory-why-the-demos-should-be-bounded-by-the-state/7D987CC61381C0EBE5CB9F5C1E4D3F48","volume":"4"},

  {"id":"sossPoliceAreOur2017","abstract":"Against the backdrop of Ferguson and the Black Lives Matter movement, we ask what the American politics subfield has to say about the political lives of communities subjugated by race and class. We argue that mainstream research in this subfield—framed by images of representative democracy and Marshallian citizenship—has provided a rich portrait of what such communities lack in political life. Indeed, by focusing so effectively on their political marginalization, political scientists have ironically made such communities marginal to the subfield's account of American democracy and citizenship. In this article, we provide a corrective by focusing on what is present in the political lives of such communities. To redress the current imbalance and advance the understandings of race and class in American politics, we argue that studies of the liberal-democratic “first face” of the state must be complemented by greater attention to the state's more controlling “second face.” Focusing on policing, we seek to unsettle the mainstream of a subfield that rarely inquires into governmental practices of social control and the ways “race-class subjugated communities” are governed through coercion, containment, repression, surveillance, regulation, predation, discipline, and violence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Soss","given":"Joe"},{"family":"Weaver","given":"Vesla"}],"container-title":"Annual Review of Political Science","DOI":"10.1146/annurev-polisci-060415-093825","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"page":"565-591","source":"Annual Reviews","title":"Police Are Our Government: Politics, Political Science, and the Policing of Race–Class Subjugated Communities","title-short":"Police Are Our Government","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-polisci-060415-093825","volume":"20"},

  {"id":"southwellMisinformationMassAudiences2018","abstract":"Lies and inaccurate information are as old as humanity, but never before have they been so easy to spread. Each moment of every day, the Internet and broadcast media purvey misinformation, either deliberately or accidentally, to a mass audience on subjects ranging from politics to consumer goods to science and medicine, among many others. Because misinformation now has the potential to affect behavior on a massive scale, it is urgently important to understand how it works and what can be done to mitigate its harmful effects.Misinformation and Mass Audiences brings together evidence and ideas from communication research, public health, psychology, political science, environmental studies, and information science to investigate what constitutes misinformation, how it spreads, and how best to counter it. The expert contributors cover such topics as whether and to what extent audiences consciously notice misinformation, the possibilities for audience deception, the ethics of satire in journalism and public affairs programming, the diffusion of rumors, the role of Internet search behavior, and the evolving efforts to counteract misinformation, such as fact-checking programs. The first comprehensive social science volume exploring the prevalence and consequences of, and remedies for, misinformation as a mass communication phenomenon, Misinformation and Mass Audiences will be a crucial resource for students and faculty researching misinformation, policymakers grappling with questions of regulation and prevention, and anyone concerned about this troubling, yet perhaps unavoidable, dimension of current media systems.","author":[{"family":"Southwell","given":"Brian G."},{"family":"Thorson","given":"Emily A."},{"family":"Sheble","given":"Laura"}],"ISBN":"978-1-4773-1456-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,24]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"320","publisher":"University of Texas Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Misinformation and Mass Audiences","type":"book"},

  {"id":"sparksPolarizationTopTwoPrimary2019","abstract":"Top-two primaries reshape the electoral process by changing the mix of opponents that candidates face, thus altering the electorate to which they must respond. Specifically, when top-two primaries produce two same-party opponents for the general election, candidates cannot simply rely on party-based voting to win. Advocates of the top-two primary system contend that if safe districts offer voters the choice between ideologically extreme and moderate candidates of the same party in the general election, voters should choose the more moderate option. Research to date suggests that this is not the case. If the top-two primary does invoke moderation, I argue that it should be because it is self-imposed by candidates in response to new electoral incentives. The change in primary rules should cause candidates to self-moderate in hopes of broadening the range of potential voters that they may capture. I test this proposition by examining the rhetoric found on state legislative candidate websites during the 2016 election. Results show that those facing same-party opponents use more moderate, bipartisan, and vague messaging when compared to those facing opponents of the opposite party.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Sparks","given":"Steven"}],"container-title":"Political Communication","DOI":"10.1080/10584609.2019.1579772","ISSN":"1058-4609","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"page":"565-585","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Polarization and the Top-Two Primary: Moderating Candidate Rhetoric in One-Party Contests","title-short":"Polarization and the Top-Two Primary","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10584609.2019.1579772","volume":"36"},

  {"id":"speicherPotentialDiscriminationOnline","abstract":"Recently, online targeted advertising platforms like Facebook have been criticized for allowing advertisers to discriminate against users belonging to sensitive groups, i.e., to exclude users belonging to a certain race or gender from receiving their ads. Such criticisms have led, for instance, Facebook to disallow the use of attributes such as ethnic aﬃnity from being used by advertisers when targeting ads related to housing or employment or ﬁnancial services. In this paper, we show that such measures are far from suﬃcient and that the problem of discrimination in targeted advertising is much more pernicious. We argue that discrimination measures should be based on the targeted population and not on the attributes used for targeting. We systematically investigate the diﬀerent targeting methods oﬀered by Facebook for their ability to enable discriminatory advertising. We show that a malicious advertiser can create highly discriminatory ads without using sensitive attributes. Our ﬁndings call for exploring fundamentally new methods for mitigating discrimination in online targeted advertising.","author":[{"family":"Speicher","given":"Till"},{"family":"Ali","given":"Muhammad"},{"family":"Venkatadri","given":"Giridhari"},{"family":"Ribeiro","given":"Filipe Nunes"},{"family":"Arvanitakis","given":"George"},{"family":"Benevenuto","given":"Fabrício"},{"family":"Gummadi","given":"Krishna P"},{"family":"Loiseau","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Mislove","given":"Alan"}],"language":"en","page":"15","source":"Zotero","title":"Potential for Discrimination in Online Targeted Advertising","type":"article-journal"},

Hayek argued for the desirability of decentralized systems of human interaction in light of the limits on human rationality, the importance of rules in a social and political order, and the limits of democracy as expressed through majority rule. These ideas can be interpreted as supporting the exercise of significant administrative discretion in public policy within rules that limit arbitrary actions against citizens.

Recently, online SET (instead of the traditional paper-and-pencil questionnaires) has become the established means for gathering students’ opinions. Obviously, online surveys have great advantages, but their greatest challenge remains the low response rates that might affect the representativeness of the sample. This paper contains a non-response analysis on online SET-data using multilevel logistic models. At the student level, course grade, program level, and the number of course evaluations a student was asked to complete are significant predictors for participation. Student's gender and study domain are not significant. The variance component of the course level is estimated to be 0.

However, the relationship between students’ perceptions of (the value of) of SET procedures and their SET scores has not yet been studied. At the University of Antwerp (Belgium), 974 students from 6 different academic disciplines completed both a SET form and an adapted version of the Students’ Perceptions of a Teaching Evaluation Process Questionnaire (Surrat & Desselle, 2007). Structural equation modelling was used to examine the relationships between students’ perceptions of a SET procedure and their SET scores. The analysis revealed a statistically significant positive relationship (0.20) between a latent construct measuring the perceived value of SET and SET scores, as derived from a global factor measuring general teaching competency. Students who valued SET procedures tended to provide higher SET scores. It is important to recognize that based on their conceptions of their role as evaluators of university professors, students might differ in their perceptions of teaching competence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Spooren","given":"Pieter"},{"family":"Christiaens","given":"Wim"}],"collection-title":"Evaluation of teaching: Challenges and promises","container-title":"Studies in Educational Evaluation","container-title-short":"Studies in Educational Evaluation","DOI":"10.1016/j.stueduc.2016.12.003","ISSN":"0191-491X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,1]]},"page":"43-49","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"I liked your course because I believe in (the power of) student evaluations of teaching (SET).

The review is based on the SET meta-validation model, drawing upon research reports published in peer-reviewed journals since 2000. Through the lens of validity, we consider both the more traditional research themes in the field of SET (i.e., the dimensionality debate, the ‘bias’ question, and questionnaire design) and some recent trends in SET research, such as online SET and bias investigations into additional teacher personal characteristics. The review provides a clear idea of the state of the art with regard to research on SET, thus allowing researchers to formulate suggestions for future research. It is argued that SET remains a current yet delicate topic in higher education, as well as in education research. Many stakeholders are not convinced of the usefulness and validity of SET for both formative and summative purposes. Research on SET has thus far failed to provide clear answers to several critical questions concerning the validity of SET.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Spooren","given":"Pieter"},{"family":"Brockx","given":"Bert"},{"family":"Mortelmans","given":"Dimitri"}],"container-title":"Review of Educational Research","container-title-short":"Review of Educational Research","DOI":"10.3102/0034654313496870","ISSN":"0034-6543","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"598-642","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"On the Validity of Student Evaluation of Teaching: The State of the Art","title-short":"On the Validity of Student Evaluation of Teaching","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.3102/0034654313496870","volume":"83"},

Using a mixed-method approach based on seed data collected from Twitter, and then extending out to the websites cited in that data, we examine content sharing practices across distinct media domains that functioned to construct, shape, and propagate these narratives. We articulate a predominantly alternative media “echo-system” of websites that repeatedly share content about the White Helmets. Among other findings, our work reveals a small set of websites and authors generating content that is spread across diverse sites, drawing audiences from distinct communities into a shared narrative. This analysis also reveals the integration of government-funded media and geopolitical think tanks as source content for anti-White Helmets narratives. More broadly, the analysis demonstrates the role of alternative newswire-like services in providing content for alternative media websites.

Our findings demonstrate how alternative news sites propagate and shape alternative narratives, while mainstream media deny them. We explain how political leanings of alternative news sites do not align well with a U.S. left-right spectrum, but instead feature an antiglobalist (vs. globalist) orientation where U.S. Alt-Right sites look similar to U.S. Alt-Left sites. Our findings describe a subsection of the emerging alternative media ecosystem and provide insight in how websites that promote conspiracy theories and pseudo-science may function to conduct underlying political agendas.","author":[{"family":"Starbird","given":"Kate"}],"language":"en","page":"10","source":"Zotero","title":"Examining the Alternative Media Ecosystem through the Production of Alternative Narratives of Mass Shooting Events on Twitter","type":"article-journal"},

In this article, I argue that, properly understood, Washington's request and the Court's refusal shed new light on the underlying theoretical rationale for executive–judicial cooperation and the political dangers of this cooperation. Moreover, by attending to the actions of the Washington administration in the aftermath of the Court's refusal, I show that the manner in which presidents interact with the people cannot be neatly separated from the institutional relationships between the branches of government.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Starr","given":"Nicholas C."}],"container-title":"Presidential Studies Quarterly","DOI":"10.1111/psq.12212","ISSN":"1741-5705","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"language":"en","page":"602-618","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The Historical Presidency: Competing Conceptions of the Separation of Powers: Washington's Request for an Advisory Opinion in the Crisis of 1793","title-short":"The Historical Presidency","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/psq.12212","volume":"45"},

  {"id":"stengelInformationWarsHow2019","abstract":"During the final three years of the Obama administration, Richard Stengel, the former editor of Time magazine and an Under Secretary of State, was on the front lines of the new global information war. At the time, he was the single person in government tasked with unpacking, disproving and combating both ISIS's messaging and Russian disinformation. Then, in 2016, as the presidential election unfolded, Stengel watched as Donald Trump used disinformation himself, weaponizing the grievances of Americans who felt overlooked. In fact, Stengel quickly came to see how all three players had used the same playbook: ISIS sought to make Islam great again; Putin tried to make Russia great again; and we all know about Trump. In a narrative that is by turns dramatic and eye-opening, Information Wars walks readers through of this often frustrating battle. Stengel moves through Russia and Ukraine, Saudi Arabia and Iraq, and introduces characters from Putin to Hillary Clinton, John Kerry and Mohamed bin Salman to show how disinformation is impacting our global society. He illustrates how ISIS terrorized the world using social media, and how the Russians launched a tsunami of disinformation around the annexation of Crimea - a scheme that became the model for their interference with the 2016 presidential election. An urgent book for our times, Information Wars stresses that we must find a way to combat this ever growing threat to democracy.","author":[{"family":"Stengel","given":"Richard"}],"ISBN":"978-1-61185-902-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,10]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"340","publisher":"Atlantic Books","source":"Google Books","title":"Information Wars: How We Lost the Global Battle Against Disinformation and What We Can Do About It","title-short":"Information Wars","type":"book"},

  {"id":"sterrettWhoSharedIt2019","abstract":"Social media platforms are becoming increasingly popular news sources. They differ from traditional media as people are exposed to stories from a variety of people and outlets, including potential fake news stories. This raises a key question: What leads people to trust news on social media? Research indicates two cues that could impact opinions of news on social media: (1) the trustworthiness of the person who shares a story; (2) the credibility of the news outlet reporting the story. This study tests those factors simultaneously with a recent survey experiment of American adults that simulates social media posts by either a trusted or untrusted public figure and directs respondents to an article manipulated to come from either a reputable news source or a fake news source. The findings highlight the impact elites sharing a story has on views toward an article on social media compared with the effects of the news outlet reporting the story. The study has significant implications for researchers, citizens, and publishers trying to understand how people evaluate the trustworthiness of news on social media and the potential impact of fake news.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Sterrett","given":"David"},{"family":"Malato","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Benz","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Kantor","given":"Liz"},{"family":"Tompson","given":"Trevor"},{"family":"Rosenstiel","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Sonderman","given":"Jeff"},{"family":"Loker","given":"Kevin"}],"container-title":"Digital Journalism","DOI":"10.1080/21670811.2019.1623702","ISSN":"2167-0811","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,3]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/21670811.2019.1623702","page":"783-801","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Who Shared It?: Deciding What News to Trust on Social Media","title-short":"Who Shared It?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/21670811.2019.1623702","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"stewartInformationGerrymanderingUndemocratic2019","abstract":"People must integrate disparate sources of information when making decisions, especially in social contexts. But information does not always flow freely. It can be constrained by social networks and distorted by zealots and automated bots. Here we develop a voter game as a model system to study information flow in collective decisions. Players are assigned to competing groups (parties) and placed on an ‘influence network’ that determines whose voting intentions each player can observe. Players are incentivized to vote according to partisan interest, but also to coordinate their vote with the entire group. Our mathematical analysis uncovers a phenomenon that we call information gerrymandering: the structure of the influence network can sway the vote outcome towards one party, even when both parties have equal sizes and each player has the same influence. A small number of zealots, when strategically placed on the influence network, can also induce information gerrymandering and thereby bias vote outcomes. We confirm the predicted effects of information gerrymandering in social network experiments with n = 2,520 human subjects. Furthermore, we identify extensive information gerrymandering in real-world influence networks, including online political discussions leading up to the US federal elections, and in historical patterns of bill co-sponsorship in the US Congress and European legislatures. Our analysis provides an account of the vulnerabilities of collective decision-making to systematic distortion by restricted information flow. Our analysis also highlights a group-level social dilemma: information gerrymandering can enable one party to sway decisions in its favour, but when multiple parties engage in gerrymandering the group loses its ability to reach consensus and remains trapped in deadlock.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Stewart","given":"Alexander J."},{"family":"Mosleh","given":"Mohsen"},{"family":"Diakonova","given":"Marina"},{"family":"Arechar","given":"Antonio A."},{"family":"Rand","given":"David G."},{"family":"Plotkin","given":"Joshua B."}],"container-title":"Nature","container-title-short":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-019-1507-6","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7772","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9]]},"language":"en","page":"117-121","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Information gerrymandering and undemocratic decisions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1507-6","volume":"573"},

  {"id":"stilzDECOLONIZATIONSELFDETERMINATION2015","abstract":"While self-determination is a cardinal principle of international law, its meaning is often obscure. Yet international law clearly recognizes decolonization as a central application of the principle. Most ordinary people also agree that the liberation of colonial peoples was a moral triumph. This essay examines three philosophical theories of self-determination’s value, and asks which one best captures the reasons why decolonization was morally required. The instrumentalist theory holds that decolonization was required because subject peoples were unjustly governed, the democratic view holds that decolonization was required because subject peoples lacked democratic representation, and the associative view holds that decolonization was required because subject peoples were unable to affirm the political institutions their colonial rulers imposed on them. I argue that the associative view is superior to competing accounts, because it better reflects individuals’ “maker” interests in participating in shared political projects that they value. The essay further shows that if we accept the associative view, self-determination is not a sui generis value that applies to decolonization alone. Ultimately, our intuitions about decolonization can be justified only by invoking an interest on the part of persistently alienated groups in redrawing political boundaries. The same interest may justify self-determination in additional cases, such as autonomy for indigenous peoples, or greater independence for Scotland or Quebec.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Stilz","given":"Anna"}],"container-title":"Social Philosophy and Policy","DOI":"10.1017/S0265052515000059","ISSN":"0265-0525, 1471-6437","issue":"1","issued":{"literal":"2015/ed"},"language":"en","page":"1-24","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"DECOLONIZATION AND SELF-DETERMINATION","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/social-philosophy-and-policy/article/decolonization-and-selfdetermination/A5E1F0CE272476C91C15E1BB82CF4A4F","volume":"32"},

  {"id":"stoneSortitionVotingDemocratic2016","abstract":"In recent years, democrats both inside and outside the academy have begun to reconsider the merits of the age-old practice of sortition, the random selection of political officials. Despite this fact, however, the comparative assessment of the merits of voting and sortition remains in its infancy. This paper will advance this project by treating the problem of assigning public responsibilities as a problem of allocative justice. To treat the problem in this manner is to treat public office as a type of good to which citizens might have various claims. Random selection is the appropriate method for distributing public office when all citizens have equal claims to that office and there is not enough to go around. Universal distribution is more appropriate when all claimants have equal claims to the office and there is enough to go around (as with universal suffrage, for example). Election (or possibly other procedures, such as appointment) makes sense when citizens do not enjoy equal claims to the office and that office is in scarce supply. This approach captures a crucial component of democratic equality. Different understandings of democratic equality lay behind sortition and election. Each might be appropriate under different circumstances, but both place rights-based constraints on the design of a democratic political system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Stone","given":"Peter"}],"container-title":"Critical Review of International Social and Political Philosophy","DOI":"10.1080/13698230.2016.1144858","ISSN":"1369-8230","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,5,3]]},"page":"339-356","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Sortition, voting, and democratic equality","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13698230.2016.1144858","volume":"19"},

The Chinese information regime is a marvel of networked information control, and provokes questions about what a democracy should and should not do.

  {"id":"streetHistoriographyBlackPanther2010","abstract":"This article examines forty years of historical writing on the Black Panther Party (BPP), arguing that this historiography has now reached maturity. It evaluates key publications on the BPP, splitting the historiography into three periods. The first phase, the article asserts, was dominated by accounts written by participants and observers of the BPP in action. These offered insight into the personalities of the BPP leadership but included relatively little on other BPP members. They were supplemented by a collection of friendly academic studies, a number of which emphasized the role of the FBI in precipitating the BPP's decline. The article identifies the 1994 publication of Hugh Pearson's biographical study of Huey P. Newton as the beginning of a second phase. Pearson's work, which built on a collection of accounts written by observers and right-wing writers during the first phase, precipitated an outpouring of new studies that opposed its conclusions. These works overwhelmingly focussed on individual BPP chapters and the experiences of the BPP rank and file; they were generally friendly towards the party and often appraised the BPP's actions through the 1970s. A second wave of participant accounts also emerged in this period which offered a more personal interpretation of the BPP's decline. A third period emerged in the early 2000s that abandoned the obsession with Pearson's study and focussed instead on the BPP's contribution to African American and American culture beyond its political program and violent image. The article reveals the paradox at the heart of the local approach, one which recent studies addressed in their focus on the BPP's Oakland chapter and their return to a tight chronological approach that focussed on the BPP's peak years. It concludes by noting the remaining omissions in the BPP's historical record and anticipating further studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Street","given":"Joe"}],"container-title":"Journal of American Studies","DOI":"10.1017/S0021875809991320","ISSN":"1469-5154, 0021-8758","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,5]]},"language":"en","page":"351-375","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"The Historiography of the Black Panther Party","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-american-studies/article/historiography-of-the-black-panther-party/A8E54ADE9F70F86F62C91C8946920824","volume":"44"},

  {"id":"stukalDetectingBotsRussian2017","abstract":"Automated and semiautomated Twitter accounts, bots, have recently gained significant public attention due to their potential interference in the political realm. In this study, we develop a methodology for detecting bots on Twitter using an ensemble of classifiers and apply it to study bot activity within political discussions in the Russian Twittersphere. We focus on the interval from February 2014 to December 2015, an especially consequential period in Russian politics. Among accounts actively Tweeting about Russian politics, we find that on the majority of days, the proportion of Tweets produced by bots exceeds 50%. We reveal bot characteristics that distinguish them from humans in this corpus, and find that the software platform used for Tweeting is among the best predictors of bots. Finally, we find suggestive evidence that one prominent activity that bots were involved in on Russian political Twitter is the spread of news stories and promotion of media who produce them.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Stukal","given":"Denis"},{"family":"Sanovich","given":"Sergey"},{"family":"Bonneau","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Tucker","given":"Joshua A."}],"container-title":"Big Data","container-title-short":"Big Data","DOI":"10.1089/big.2017.0038","ISSN":"2167-6461","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,12,1]]},"page":"310-324","publisher":"Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers","source":"www-liebertpub-com.proxy.lib.uiowa.edu (Atypon)","title":"Detecting Bots on Russian Political Twitter","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/big.2017.0038","volume":"5"},

However, even in the Russian domestic context, where anecdotal evidence of state activity online goes back almost a decade, no public systematic attempt has been made to dissect the population of Russian social media bots by their political orientation. We address this gap by developing a deep neural network classifier that separates pro-regime, anti-regime, and neutral Russian Twitter bots. Our method relies on supervised machine learning and a new large set of labeled accounts, rather than externally obtained account affiliations or orientation of elites. We also illustrate the use of our method by applying it to bots operating in Russian political Twitter from 2015 to 2017 and show that both pro- and anti-Kremlin bots had a substantial presence on Twitter.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Stukal","given":"Denis"},{"family":"Sanovich","given":"Sergey"},{"family":"Tucker","given":"Joshua A."},{"family":"Bonneau","given":"Richard"}],"container-title":"SAGE Open","DOI":"10.1177/2158244019827715","ISSN":"2158-2440, 2158-2440","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,4]]},"language":"en","page":"215824401982771","source":"Crossref","title":"For Whom the Bot Tolls: A Neural Networks Approach to Measuring Political Orientation of Twitter Bots in Russia","title-short":"For Whom the Bot Tolls","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2158244019827715","volume":"9"},

This essay, based on the 2018 LSE Behavioural Public Policy Lecture delivered in February 2018, explores two potential answers. The first points to a revision or weakening of social norms, which leads people to express outrage that they had previously suppressed. The second points to a revision or weakening of social norms, which leads people to express outrage that they had not previously felt (and may or may not now feel). The intensity of outrage is often a product of what is most salient. It is also a product of ‘normalization’; people compare apparently outrageous behavior to behavior falling into the same category in which it is observed, and do not compare it to other cases, which leads to predictable incoherence in judgments. These points bear on the #MeToo movement of 2017 and 2018 and the rise and fall (and rise again, and fall again) of discrimination on the basis of sex and race (and also religion and ethnicity).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Sunstein","given":"Cass R."}],"container-title":"Behavioural Public Policy","DOI":"10.1017/bpp.2018.8","ISSN":"2398-063X, 2398-0648","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5]]},"language":"en","page":"1-16","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Growing outrage","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioural-public-policy/article/growing-outrage/07A7377940D8BA0E503DDB8C10EEC70F","volume":"3"},

Using an online survey that exposes respondents to multiple news articles on a given public issue, this study found that perceptions of issue frame believability, bias, importance and inﬂuence signiﬁcantly aﬀected audience intention to share a news article. However, perceiving an issue frame to be believable is not suﬃcient for readers to forward that article. Moreover, these frame perceptions are formed through the lens of one's political ideology.

While there are no easy solutions to resolving many of the current ethical problems related to policing and punishment, this paper will argue that some of our current practices, practices that many people believe are morally problematic (e.g., our current approach to prison labor), not only are not problematic, but also can point us toward more effective and efficient policy solutions in other areas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Surprenant","given":"Chris W."}],"container-title":"Journal of Business Ethics","container-title-short":"J Bus Ethics","DOI":"10.1007/s10551-017-3744-7","ISSN":"0167-4544, 1573-0697","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9]]},"language":"en","page":"119-131","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Policing and Punishment for Profit","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10551-017-3744-7","volume":"159"},

In this article, I propose that the legitimacy of governance of users by platforms should be evaluated against the values of the rule of law. In particular, I suggest that we should care deeply about the extent to which private governance is consensual, transparent, equally applied and relatively stable, and fairly enforced. These are the core values of good governance, but are alien to the systems of contract law that currently underpin relationships between platforms and their users. Through an analysis of the contractual Terms of Service of 14 major social media platforms, I show how these values can be applied to evaluate governance, and how poorly platforms perform on these criteria. I argue that the values of the rule of law provide a language to name and work through contested concerns about the relationship between platforms and their users. This is an increasingly urgent task. Finding a way to apply these values to articulate a set of desirable restraints on the exercise of power in the digital age is the key challenge and opportunity of the project of digital constitutionalism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Suzor","given":"Nicolas"}],"container-title":"Social Media + Society","container-title-short":"Social Media + Society","DOI":"10.1177/2056305118787812","ISSN":"2056-3051","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"11","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Digital Constitutionalism: Using the Rule of Law to Evaluate the Legitimacy of Governance by Platforms","title-short":"Digital Constitutionalism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/2056305118787812","volume":"4"},

This work builds on the efforts of a broad range of researchers already working to systematically investigate the governance of social media platforms and telecommunications intermediaries.

  {"id":"suzorResponsibilitiesPlatformsNew2016","abstract":"This paper reviews the legitimacy terms of service of fifteen of the largest English-language social media platforms through the lens of the rule law. Each contract was analyzed to identify the extent to which they provided protections for due process interests of users. In all cases examined, the terms of service provided broad, unfettered discretion to platform owners. This is a serious failing from the perspective of the rule of law. Like constitutional documents, terms of service grant powers; but unlike constitutions, they rarely limit those powers or regulate the ways they are exercised.\n\nThis paper takes stock of current debates about governance of the internet and the role of intermediaries in enforcing legal and social norms. I highlight the extents and limits of different forms of control that intermediaries can exercise over their users, and the social, legal, economic, and technical forces that act on intermediaries themselves.\n\nI argue that a new constitutionalism is needed to protect substantive and procedural rights in a decentralized regulatory environment. Recognizing that intermediaries always exercise some degree of regulatory control over their networks, I argue that some level of decentralization of governance is both inevitable and desirable. It will become increasingly important, however, to ensure that private platforms enforce rules in a manner that is regular, transparent, equally and proportionately applied, and fair. This paper seeks to progress this debate by providing a framework to evaluate the legitimacy of platform governance in practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Suzor","given":"Nicolas"}],"container-title":"AoIR Selected Papers of Internet Research","ISSN":"2162-3317","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en-US","source":"journals.uic.edu","title":"The responsibilities of platforms: a new constitutionalism to promote the legitimacy of decentralized governance","title-short":"The responsibilities of platforms","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/spir/article/view/9055","volume":"6"},

We identify gaps in knowledge through a thematic analysis of 380 survey responses from individuals who have been the subject of content moderation decisions. We argue that meaningful transparency should be understood as a component of a communicative process of accountability (rendering account) to independent stakeholders. We make specific recommendations for platforms to provide people with clear information about decisions that affect them, including what content is moderated, which rule was breached, and a description of the people and automated processes responsible for identifying content and making the decision. Beyond providing more information to individuals about particular decisions, however, we note the major challenge of improving understanding of content moderation at a systems level. General demands for greater transparency should be reframed to focus on enhanced access to large-scale disaggregated data that can enable new methods and collaborations among academia, civil society, and journalists to make these systems more understandable and accountable.","author":[{"family":"Suzor","given":"Nicolas P."},{"family":"West","given":"Sarah Myers"},{"family":"Quodling","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"York","given":"Jillian"}],"container-title":"International Journal of Communication","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"1526-1543","source":"Zotero","title":"What Do We Mean When We Talk About Transparency?

  {"id":"tandocFactsFakeNews2019","abstract":"This article offers a review of scholarly research on the phenomenon of fake news. Most studies have so far focused on three main themes: the definition and the scope of the problem; the potential causes; and the impact of proposed solutions. First, scholarly research has defined fake news as a form of falsehood intended to primarily deceive people by mimicking the look and feel of real news. While initial research has shown that only a small fraction of the online audience is exposed to fake news, for this small group of individuals, the impact of fake news can be quite substantial. Second, studies have identified cognitive processes that make individuals more prone to the influence of fake news, such as confirmation bias, selective exposure, and lack of analytical thinking. Fake news also derives its power from its appeal to partisanship, perceived novelty, and repeated exposure facilitated by both bots and human users that share them in the online sphere. Finally, while fact checking has also risen in response to fake news, studies have found that corrections to wrong information only work on some individuals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Tandoc","given":"Edson C."}],"container-title":"Sociology Compass","DOI":"10.1111/soc4.12724","ISSN":"1751-9020","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"e12724","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The facts of fake news: A research review","title-short":"The facts of fake news","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/soc4.12724","volume":"13"},

Once the headquarters for George Washington and the Continental Army, and later a hub for industry and transportation, Newburgh was falling into ruin. Its population was declining, its housing stock decaying, and its economy failing. City Manager Joseph McDowell Mitchell claimed to know exactly whom to blame: the city's hundreds of \"chiselers and loafers,\" \"freeload[ing]\" migrants, \"social parasites,\" and \"illegitimate children.\" They burned through \"taxpayer\" dollars, he alleged, bringing in return only crime, blight, and immoral behavior.

Drawing on a wealth of previously un-mined legal and archival sources, Karen Tani reveals how reformers attempted to build a more bureaucratic, centralized, and uniform public welfare system; how traditions of localism, federalism, and hostility towards the 'undeserving poor' affected their efforts; and how, along the way, more and more Americans came to speak of public income support in the powerful but limiting language of law and rights\"","author":[{"family":"Tani","given":"Karen M."}],"call-number":"KF3720 .T36 2016","collection-title":"Studies in legal history","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-1-107-07684-6 978-1-107-43408-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"427","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"States of dependency: welfare, rights, and American governance, 1935-1972","title-short":"States of dependency","type":"book"},

Meanwhile, Americans witnessed the steady expansion of central state authority. By the 1940s, neither the states nor the federal government enjoyed many areas of exclusive jurisdiction. The federal and state governments' relationships with their subjects were similarly in flux, and the stakes were high. As a result of New Deal social welfare programs, as well as numerous war-related measures, the benefits of state and national citizenship had expanded by the late 1940s. The burdens of citizenship had expanded, too, in the form of higher and broader taxation, compulsory military service, and more government oversight. The stage was set for fierce conflicts over the borders of the nation's political communities and the terms of belonging.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Tani","given":"Karen M."}],"container-title":"Law and History Review","DOI":"10.1017/S073824801400056X","ISSN":"0738-2480, 1939-9022","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,2]]},"language":"en","page":"1-40","source":"Crossref","title":"States' Rights, Welfare Rights, and the “Indian Problem”: Negotiating Citizenship and Sovereignty, 1935–1954","title-short":"States' Rights, Welfare Rights, and the “Indian Problem”","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S073824801400056X/type/journal_article","volume":"33"},

This Article addresses that lacuna by examining the rise of a vibrant language of rights within the federal social welfare bureaucracy during the 1930s and 1940s. This language is barely visible in judicial and legislative records, the traditional source base for legal-historical inquiry, but amply evidenced by previously unmined administrative records.

  {"id":"tanPlatformPricingInvestment2020","abstract":"Many two-sided platforms (for example, eBay, Google, iOS, Android, Twitter, and Amazon) provide integration tools, such as modular interfaces, interactive development environments, application programming interfaces, and help desks, to reduce the costs and improve the functionality of third-party content developed for the platform. The need for such investment is increasing with the rise of major new markets as the result of technologies, such as the “Internet of Things.” Although crucial to platform success, platform integration tools are costly to create. We develop an analytic model to explore the key tradeoffs behind investment in integration tools and how that investment interacts with pricing decisions in a two-sided market. We model these decisions for hardware/software platforms as well as hybrid retail platforms and analyze them under various scenarios, including monopoly and competition. Our results suggest that considering integration investment can create market regimes in which the standard pricing results from the extant platform literature no longer hold. For example, the tendency to reduce prices to one side of a market in response to increasing the benefit of the network to the other side may be suboptimal in the presence of integration investment. Therefore, integration investments must be well coordinated with pricing decisions made for both sides of the market. In general, higher levels of investment by hardware/software platforms into integration become desirable when the platform (1) has access to a large pool of content providers and consumers, (2) is able to develop integration tools that are highly effective in reducing third-party development costs, and (3) operates in a market in which content providers earn a high-enough profit margin creating content that is highly valued by the consumer market. Hybrid retail platforms often show similar behavior. However, there are some nuances.

Starting with an information-centric perspective, we use the theoretical lens of information processing, to examine the roles of Twitter affordances during the Occupy movement in solving information problems. Our data is a corpus of tweets from the core actors of the movement, as identified by our extended 1/9/90 rule. Using inferential statistics and network visualization, we show how different Twitter affordances act as mechanisms to resolve information problems in many different ways. Our network visualization shows the ecology of the interactions amongst the core actors, and between the core actors and the public.

  {"id":"taplinMoveFastBreak2017","abstract":"Jonathan Taplin tells the story of how a small group of libertarian entrepreneurs began in the 1990s to hijack the original decentralized vision of the Internet, in the process creating three monopoly firms -- Facebook, Amazon and Google -- that now determine the future of the music, film, television, publishing and news industries. Taplin offers a history of how online life began to be shaped around the values of the men who founded these companies, including Peter Thiel and Larry Page: tolerating piracy of books, music and film while at the same time promoting opaque business practices and subordinating privacy of individual users to create the surveillance marketing monoculture in which we now live. The enormous profits that have come with this concentration of power tell their own story. More creative content is being consumed that ever before, but less revenue is flowing to creators and owners of the content. Google, Facebook and Amazon now enjoy political power on par with Big Oil and Big Pharma, which in part explains how such a tremendous shift in revenues from artists to platforms could have been achieved and why it has gone unchallenged for so long. As Taplin observes, the fact that more and more Americans receive their news, music and other forms of entertainment from a small group of companies poses a real threat to democracy. Move Fast and Break Things offers a prescription for how artists can reclaim their audiences using knowledge of the past and a determination to work together. Using his own half century career as a music and film producer and early pioneer of streaming video online, Taplin offers new ways to think about the design of the World Wide Web and specifically the way we live with the firms that dominate it","author":[{"family":"Taplin","given":"Jonathan T."}],"call-number":"HM851 .T365 2017","edition":"First edition","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-316-27577-4 978-0-316-50827-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"note":"OCLC: ocn981760522","number-of-pages":"308","publisher":"Little, Brown and Company","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Move fast and break things: how Facebook, Google, and Amazon cornered culture and undermined democracy","title-short":"Move fast and break things","type":"book"},

The essay argues that most metropolitan residents have not shared Jacobs’s enthusiasm for diverse, dense, eyes-on-the-street, sidewalk-oriented residential life but instead have gravitated to suburbs, high-rise condominiums, or bland gentrified neighborhoods. Residents have preferred peace and tranquility over vitality and have zoned their lives, maintaining separate physical spheres for home, work, and amusement. The fascination of the great cosmopolitan metropolis is not the diversity and vitality that exists within each block and within walking distance of each residence.

  {"id":"tekinFoundingActsConstitutional2016","abstract":"Founding Acts argues that how constitutions are made (or their pedigree) is morally and politically as significant as what they are made of (or their content). On this view, democratic constitution-making is not only about making a democratic constitution, but also about making it democratically. \"All democratic constitutions feature 'the people' as their author and ultimate source of legitimacy. They claim to embody the political form that citizens are in some sense supposed to have given themselves. But in what sense, exactly? When does a constitution really or genuinely speak for the people? Such questions are especially pertinent to our present condition, where the voice of 'the people' turns out to be irrevocably fragmented, and people themselves want to speak and be heard in their own voices. Founding Acts explores the relationship between constitutional claims of popular sovereignty and the practice of constitution-making in our pluralistic age. Serdar Tekin argues that the process of making a constitution, or its pedigree, is as morally and politically significant as its content. Consequently, democratic constitution-making is not only about making a democratic constitution but also about making it, as much as possible, democratically. Tekin develops two overarching arguments in support of this claim. First, citizen participation in the process of constitution-making is essential to the democratic legitimacy of a new constitution. Second, collective action, that is, the political experience of constructing public life together, is what binds diverse people into a democratic peoplehood. Bringing into dialogue a wide range of canonical and contemporary thinkers, Tekin examines historical realities extending from revolutionary America and France to contemporary South Africa and Germany\"--Publisher.","author":[{"family":"Tekin","given":"Serdar."}],"event-place":"Philadelphia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"English","publisher":"University of Pennsylvania Press","publisher-place":"Philadelphia","title":"Founding Acts : Constitutional Origins in a Democratic Age.","type":"book","URL":"http://public.eblib.com/choice/publicfullrecord.aspx?p=4540265"},

We assess the distribution of complaints and dispositions, along with the relationship between officer- and citizen-based characteristics. Further, we examine the extent to which varying types of investigatory models (e.g., internal affairs, command level, and external civilian oversight) influence whether complaints are found to have merit (i.e., sustained complaints). In line with prior research, we found that a small percentage of officers accounted for a disproportionate percentage of total complaints, excessive force and discourtesy were often the most common allegations lodged, and younger officers and those with less experience generally received a greater number of complaints. Adding to the literature, we found substantial variation across agencies with respect to the raw number of complaints generated, the extent to which use of force and discourtesy complaints accounted for the total number of complaints overall, and the extent to which various agencies sustained complaints. We also found that male and non-White complainants were more likely to lodge use of force allegations, with Black complainants less likely to have their complaints sustained. Moreover, cities where the police internal affairs unit served as the investigatory entity, but had their outcome decisions (i.e., dispositions) reviewed by an external civilian oversight agency, were significantly more likely to sustain complaints.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Terrill","given":"William"},{"family":"Ingram","given":"Jason R."}],"container-title":"Police Quarterly","DOI":"10.1177/1098611115613320","ISSN":"1098-6111, 1552-745X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,6]]},"language":"en","page":"150-179","source":"Crossref","title":"Citizen Complaints Against the Police: An Eight City Examination","title-short":"Citizen Complaints Against the Police","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1098611115613320","volume":"19"},

By examining police employment and demographic data for every general-service police jurisdiction in the US, I ﬁnd that poor and heavily-nonwhite jurisdictions employ far fewer ofﬁcers per crime than wealthy and white jurisdictions do. That ﬁnding contrasts with an older body of literature on the distribution of police protection, which examined the distribution of police resources across neighborhoods within individual cities and found little inequality. I also ﬁnd that inequality in police protection has grown since 1970—a ﬁnding that contrasts with the increasingly equal distribution of resources for education, the other major claim on local government revenues—largely because criminal victimization became more concentrated in disadvantaged communities. (In the process, I ﬁnd that contrary to widespread impressions, the crime rate fell very little in the most disadvantaged jurisdictions from 1980 to 2000, and violent crime actually increased). Finally, by examining data about federal grant programs, I ﬁnd that the rise of federal contributions to local policing in the 1990s slowed the growth of inequality somewhat, suggesting that revenue-sharing has a real but modest role to play in reducing inequality in police protection.

  {"id":"thompsonDavidWalkerNationalism2017","abstract":"This essay proceeds from an examination of two spectacular expressions of nationalist identity in the early republic. First, the Declaration of Independence and subsequent articulations of the exclusionary, white supremacist, character of its rights claims prompted by Jefferson’s Notes on the State of Virginia and congressional debate over the admission of Missouri. Second, David Walker’s Appeal to the Coloured Citizens of the World 1829-30 and the emergence of an African-American nationalism shaped by opposition to colonization and a determination to confront racism and slavery. That these nationalisms existed in a dialectic relationship is an established feature of the literature. This essay breaks new ground by suggesting a similarity of intellectual provenance, specifically the application within both nationalist discourses of precepts derived from an ostensibly international law of law of nations to domestic relations between states and peoples within the United States of America. Departing from a previous emphasis on expression and outcome within the literature on both African-American and white supremacist nationalisms – or on themes of resistance, assimilation, separation or oppression – the essay seeks to place its examination of the provenance of American “nation making” in dialogue with an emerging scholarly literature on multiple national identities in regions of nineteenth century Europe.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Thompson","given":"Peter"}],"container-title":"Journal of the Early Republic","DOI":"10.1353/jer.2017.0001","ISSN":"1553-0620","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,2,23]]},"language":"en","page":"47-80","publisher":"University of Pennsylvania Press","source":"Project MUSE","title":"David Walker's Nationalism—and Thomas Jefferson's","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://muse.jhu.edu/article/649277","volume":"37"},

  {"id":"thorburnNetworkedSocialReproduction2016","abstract":"This paper argues that the means of communication are sites for, and aspects of, social reproduction. In contemporary capitalism, motivated as it is by new, networked digital technologies, social reproduction is increasingly virtualised through the means of communication. Although recent political struggles have demonstrated how networked technologies can liberate social reproduction from the profit motive and from commodifying impulses, the tendency is to invoke and accelerate socially reproductive crises – crises in the capacity to reproduce ourselves both daily and intergenerationally. These crises have psychic and corporeal impacts, and intensify Tronti’s “social factory” thesis of capital’s technical composition. In order to develop modes and means of liberatory communication in the integrated circuit it is necessary to untangle and chart both the pathways and outcomes of the crises networked social reproduction invokes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Thorburn","given":"Elise Danielle"}],"container-title":"tripleC: Communication, Capitalism & Critique.

  {"id":"thorsonAlgorithmicInferencePolitical2019","abstract":"The visibility of news and politics in a Facebook newsfeed depends on the actions of a diverse set of actors: users, their friends, content publishers such as news organizations, advertisers, and algorithms. The focus of this paper is on untangling the role of this last actor from the others. We ask, how does Facebook algorithmically infer what users are interested in, and how do interest inferences shape news exposure? We weave together survey data and interest categorization data from participants’ Facebook accounts to audit the algorithmic interest classification system on Facebook. These data allow us to model the role of algorithmic inference in shaping content exposure. We show that algorithmic ‘sorting out’ of users has consequences for who is exposed to news and politics on Facebook. People who are algorithmically categorized as interested in news or politics are more likely to attract this kind of content into their feeds – above and beyond their self-reported interest in civic content.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Thorson","given":"Kjerstin"},{"family":"Cotter","given":"Kelley"},{"family":"Medeiros","given":"Mel"},{"family":"Pak","given":"Chankyung"}],"container-title":"Information, Communication & Society","DOI":"10.1080/1369118X.2019.1642934","ISSN":"1369-118X","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,27]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2019.1642934","page":"1-18","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Algorithmic inference, political interest, and exposure to news and politics on Facebook","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2019.1642934","volume":"0"},
  {"id":"tienOnlineReactions20172019","abstract":"We study the Twitter conversation following the August 2017 `Unite the Right' rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, using tools from network analysis and data science. We use media followership on Twitter and principal component analysis (PCA) to compute a `Left'/`Right' media score on a one-dimensional axis to characterize nodes. We then use these scores, in concert with retweet relationships, to examine the structure of a retweet network of approximately 300,000 accounts that communicated with the #Charlottesville hashtag. The retweet network is sharply polarized, with an assortativity coefficient of 0.8 with respect to the sign of the media PCA score. Community detection using two approaches, a Louvain method and InfoMap, yields largely homogeneous communities in terms of Left/Right node composition. When comparing tweet content, we find that tweets about `Trump' were widespread in both the Left and Right, though the accompanying language was unsurprisingly different. Nodes with large degrees in communities on the Left include accounts that are associated with disparate areas, including activism, business, arts and entertainment, media, and politics. Support of Donald Trump was a common thread among the Right communities, connecting communities with accounts that reference white-supremacist hate symbols, communities with influential personalities in the alt-right, and the largest Right community (which includes the Twitter account FoxNews).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Tien","given":"Joseph H."},{"family":"Eisenberg","given":"Marisa C."},{"family":"Cherng","given":"Sarah T."},{"family":"Porter","given":"Mason A."}],"container-title":"arXiv:1905.07755 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,19]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Online reactions to the 2017 'Unite the Right' rally in Charlottesville: measuring polarization in Twitter networks using media followership","title-short":"Online reactions to the 2017 'Unite the Right' rally in Charlottesville","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07755"},

At least for the European experience of the past few centuries, a portrait of war makers and state makers as coercive and self-seeking entrepreneurs bears a far greater resemblance to the facts than do its chief alternatives: the idea of a social contract, the idea of an open market in which operators of armies and states offer services to willing consumers, the idea of a society whose shared norms and expectations call forth a certain kind of government.</p><p>The reflections that follow merely illustrate the analogy of war making and state making with organized crime from a few hundred years of European experience and offer tentative arguments concerning principles of change and variation underlying the experience.

Based on seventy-five in-depth interviews, students' ratings of faculty are found to be normative assessments of a professor's conformity with students' pedagogical role expectations that have been derived from a market ideology and framed by a transmission model of education embedded in the rating form. When transformed into numbers, student ratings become misconstrued as quantified measures of teaching excellence that institutionally serve to provide an illusion of objectivity and penalize faculty who adhere to an alternative critical model of pedagogy. Through the use of rating forms, academic control and professional authority are transferred from faculty to students, who, as discriminating consumers, are granted the power to further their own interests and, consequently, shape the nature and form of higher education that serves them.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Titus","given":"Jordan J."}],"container-title":"Sociological Perspectives","container-title-short":"Sociological Perspectives","DOI":"10.1525/sop.2008.51.2.397","ISSN":"0731-1214","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"397-422","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Student Ratings in a Consumerist Academy: Leveraging Pedagogical Control and Authority","title-short":"Student Ratings in a Consumerist Academy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1525/sop.2008.51.2.397","volume":"51"},

  {"id":"tomzDomesticAudienceCosts2007","abstract":"What makes international threats credible? Recent theories point to domestic audience costs—the domestic price a leader would pay for making foreign threats and then backing down. This article provides the first direct evidence of audience costs. The analysis, based on experiments embedded in public opinion surveys, shows that audience costs exist across a wide range of conditions and increase with the level of escalation. The costs are evident throughout the population, and especially among politically active citizens who have the greatest potential to shape government policy. Finally, preliminary evidence suggests that audience costs arise because citizens care about the international reputation of the country or leader. These findings help identify how, and under what conditions, domestic audiences make commitments credible. At the same time, they demonstrate the promise of using experiments to answer previously intractable questions in the field of international relations.I thank Time-sharing Experiments for the Social Sciences (TESS), the National Science Foundation (CAREER Grant SES-0548285), and the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences for financial support.

Following recent works, we can find some important clues in the long history of the term. Traditionally, dignity conveys the idea of a high and honourable position in a hierarchical order, either in society or in nature. At first glance, nothing may seem more contrary to the contemporary conception of human dignity, especially in regard to human rights. However, an account of dignity as high rank provides an illuminating perspective on the role it plays in the egalitarian discourse of human rights. In order to preserve that relational sense regarding human dignity, we can use the notion of moral status, to which some moral philosophers have paid attention in recent years.

Economic institutions pose a threat if they allow for coercive interventions, as described by Hayek in The Constitution of Liberty: by giving someone the power to force others to serve one’s will by threatening to inﬂict harm, in the absence of general rules of conduct. According to the logic of the argument, welfare-state provisions are not coercive insofar as they do not allow the identiﬁcation and discriminatory treatment of individuals.

  {"id":"trivediServeProtectEach2020","abstract":"Most American are rightly enraged when police shoot unarmed civilians, use excessive force, or engage in unethical practices like planting evidence. However, there is little popular understanding and scholarly attention as to why prosecutors fail to charge or otherwise hold officers accountable. This Article offers a novel contribution to the study of police misconduct by examining how prosecutors nationwide enable police misconduct on an institutional level.  Through both social-scientific and legal analysis, we consider the codependent relationship between prosecutors and police that prevents accountability for police violence and misconduct against the public. Specifically, we analyze (1) the cultural norms created between police and prosecutors that allow police to influence prosecutorial discretion over police accountability and (2) the legal and extralegal tools that prosecutors wield to protect their police benefactors—and themselves in the process. In contrast to other scholarship on police misconduct, we show how adjacent criminal justice institutions—police and prosecutors—enable persistent patterns of practice that operate within the boundaries of legality, but often to deadly and unethical ends. We end with potential solutions to better equip conscientious prosecutors, lawmakers, and the public to combat this codependent dynamic that has left so many communities—particularly those on the margins—afraid of the very law enforcement actors that are supposed to protect them.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Trivedi","given":"Somil"},{"family":"Gonzalez Van Cleve","given":"Nicole"}],"event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,27]]},"language":"en","number":"ID 3586770","publisher":"Social Science Research Network","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"papers.ssrn.com","title":"To Serve and Protect Each Other: How Police-Prosecutor Codependence Enables Police Misconduct","title-short":"To Serve and Protect Each Other","type":"report","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3586770"},

  {"id":"tsesisPromisesLibertyHistory2010","abstract":"In these original essays, America's leading historians and legal scholars reassess the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment and its relevance to issues of liberty, justice, and equality. The Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery in the United States, reasserting the radical, egalitarian dimensions of the Constitution. It also laid the foundations for future civil rights and social justice legislation. Yet subsequent reinterpretation and misappropriation have curbed more substantive change. With constitutional jurisprudence undergoing a revival, The Promises of Liberty provides a full portrait of the Thirteenth Amendment and its potential for ensuring liberty. The collection begins with Pulitzer Prize-winning historian David Brion Davis, who discusses the failure of the Thirteenth Amendment to achieve its framers' objectives. The next piece, by Alexander Tsesis, provides a detailed account of the Amendment's revolutionary character. James M. McPherson, another Pulitzer recipient, recounts the influence of abolitionists on the ratification process, and Paul Finkelman focuses on who freed the slaves and President Lincoln's commitment to ending slavery. Michael Vorenberg revisits the nineteenth century's understanding of freedom and citizenship and the Amendment's surprisingly small role in the Reconstruction and post-Reconstruction periods. William M. Wiecek shows how the Supreme Court's narrow interpretation once rendered the guarantee of freedom nearly illusory, and the collection's third Pulitzer Prize winner, David M. Oshinsky, explains how peonage undermined the prohibition against compulsory service. Subsequent essays relate the Thirteenth Amendment to congressional authority, hate crimes legislation, the labor movement, and immigrant rights. These chapters analyze unique features of the amendment along with its elusive meanings and affirm its power to reform criminal and immigration law, affirmative action policies, and the protection of civil liberties.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Tsesis","given":"Alexander"}],"event-place":"New York, UNITED STATES","ISBN":"978-0-231-52013-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"publisher":"Columbia University Press","publisher-place":"New York, UNITED STATES","source":"ProQuest Ebook Central","title":"The Promises of Liberty: The History and Contemporary Relevance of the Thirteenth Amendment","title-short":"The Promises of Liberty","type":"book","URL":"http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/uiowa/detail.action?docID=908767"},

  {"id":"tuckerEmployeeTheftSocial2010","abstract":"Employee theft is generally regarded as a serious offense not only by those responsible for assuring organizations operate as efficiently as possible, but by social scientists studying this phenomenon. Futhermore, in most modern settings, it is defined as criminal and subject to punishment. Although usually classified as deviant, theft is in many instances also a reaction to what employees consider is deviant behavior on the part of their employer. Consequently, a theory of social control, rather than a theory of crime, is more appropriate in explaining such theft by employees. This paper suggests that theft, as a mode of social control, is most likely among employees who occupy marginal positions in organizations, including those at the bottom of the organizational hierachy, those with little tenure, and those with few social lies. Ways of reducing employee theft consistent with this hypothesis are explored. It is concluded, however, that theft by employed members of organizations is in many cases inevit...","author":[{"family":"Tucker","given":"James"}],"container-title":"Deviant behavior","container-title-short":"Deviant Behavior","DOI":"10.1080/01639625.1989.9967820","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"page":"319-334","title":"Employee theft as social control∗","title-short":"Employee theft as social control∗","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01639625.1989.9967820","volume":"10"},

Using a comprehensive theoretical framework from the literature, NML was operationalized through four factors: functional consuming (FC), critical consuming (CC), functional prosuming (FP), and critical prosuming (CP). The results showed that FC and FP had a positive effect on CC, CP, and CS; CC had a positive effect on CP and DT; and CS had a positive effect on CC and DT.

A constitutional democracy is legitimate if it meets the test of two principles: the principles of democracy or popular sovereignty and of constitutionalism or the rule of law. There are three contemporary trends which tend to conflict with the principle of democracy and thus diminish democratic freedom. There are three responses to the lack of legitimacy of these three trends. The first is to downplay the principle of democracy in order to endorse the three trends. The second is to uphold the principle of democracy, in the form of deliberative constitutional democracy, in order to criticise aspects of the three trends and to call for further democratisation. The third trend deepens this critical response by tying the test of democratic legitimacy more closely to case studies of attempts by citizens to exercise their democratic freedom.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Tully","given":"James"}],"container-title":"The Modern Law Review","ISSN":"0026-7961","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002]]},"page":"204-228","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Unfreedom of the Moderns in Comparison to Their Ideals of Constitutional Democracy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1097637","volume":"65"},

The findings illustrate that the new challenger parties, Podemos and Ciudadanos, use the social media app in a systematic way that is distinct from the traditional mainstream parties in Spain.

Ellison broadens the Emersonians' vision by insisting that one cannot be “well awake” in America without confronting the ways historical white supremacy shapes one's identity and chances in life.

A case study of an important anti-corruption inquiry in South Africa illustrates the proposition that institutions protecting the constitution must combine independence from other political actors with some degree of accountability to them. Following the case study, the Article examines some general characteristics of these institutions, sketching some of the questions about independence and accountability that constitution-designers must consider. Among those questions are the possibility of too much independence, with the institutions having a greater impact on political outcomes than is appropriate, too much responsiveness to non-political but professional concerns such as legality and the details of accounting conventions, and of course too much accountability to the very political institutions that these agencies are designed to regulate. Throughout the Article emphasizes the role of conflicts of interest both in setting the agenda for these agencies and in posing the risk that the agencies will undermine rather than protect the constitution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Tushnet","given":"Mark"}],"container-title":"The Law & Ethics of Human Rights","DOI":"10.1515/lehr-2018-0010","ISSN":"2194-6531, 1938-2545","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,27]]},"language":"en","page":"181-202","source":"Crossref","title":"Institutions Protecting Democracy: A Preliminary Inquiry","title-short":"Institutions Protecting Democracy","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/lehr.2018.12.issue-2/lehr-2018-0010/lehr-2018-0010.xml","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"tushnetResilienceAmericanFederal2015","abstract":"Federal systems of governance have the capacity to be robust—meaning that despite internal and external changing circumstances, they can continue to produce the beneﬁts of a decentralized but internally coordinated polity. Whether or not a federal system is robust is a function of its institutional design and federal culture. The American federal system, distributing authority between levels of government, has been remarkably resilient, failing only once during the past two centuries. Its resilience surprises many who keep expecting it to wither away as the national government grows. In this chapter I make two contributions. In the ﬁrst part, I review the claims of the American federation’s inherent centralization, and suggest the evidence as well as institutional and cultural reasons why federalism may still be meaningful in the American context. Second, I present the science of federal robustness: its key is its adaptability, provided by a set of safeguards that jointly protect federalism’s boundaries while permitting experimentation around the edges. Future progress in the study of federalism obliges us to move beyond the standard equlibrium-based analysis to take a more dynamic view of federal system design and operation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Tushnet","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Graber","given":"Mark A."},{"family":"Levinson","given":"Sanford"},{"family":"Bednar","given":"Jenna"}],"container-title":"The Oxford Handbook of the U.S. Constitution","DOI":"10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190245757.013.14","editor":[{"family":"Tushnet","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Graber","given":"Mark A."},{"family":"Levinson","given":"Sanford"}],"ISBN":"978-0-19-024575-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,10,1]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"Crossref","title":"The Resilience of the American Federal System","type":"chapter","URL":"http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190245757.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780190245757-e-14"},

The lack of strong underlying cleavages indicates the polarization was not bottom up. Instead, this article argues that polarization was driven from the top down by a segment of the political class that donned the cloak of radical populist anti-establishmentarianism to gain popular support, win an election, and rewrite the constitutional rules of the game to its own benefit. The Polish case points to the importance of elite cues, and especially the pernicious consequences of system-delegitimizing rhetoric, creating distrust in the media and institutions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Tworzecki","given":"Hubert"}],"container-title":"The ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science","container-title-short":"The ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science","DOI":"10.1177/0002716218809322","ISSN":"0002-7162","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"97-119","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Poland: A Case of Top-Down Polarization","title-short":"Poland","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0002716218809322","volume":"681"},

However, there is no guarantee about the credibility of the information i.e. how legitimate is the information due to the use of crowd sourcing and absence of any central moderation. This makes it easier for malicious users and some anti-social elements to circulate rumors and create panic among the public, particularly during any real time incident or a disaster by generating fake content. Among the OSMs, the most popular micro-blogging website, Twitter, becomes an easy target for malicious users to spread misinformation having a wide variety of crowd from general public to celebrities, politicians and even large organizations. The system aims to detect such misleading information on Twitter and provide possible measures that can be adopted by the social media company to prevent the spread of misinformation and by the users who contribute to the spread without verifying the veracity of the content.","author":[{"family":"Tyagi","given":"S."},{"family":"Pai","given":"A."},{"family":"Pegado","given":"J."},{"family":"Kamath","given":"A."}],"container-title":"2019 Amity International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AICAI)","DOI":"10.1109/AICAI.2019.8701408","event":"2019 Amity International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AICAI)","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2]]},"page":"678-683","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"A Proposed Model for Preventing the spread of misinformation on Online Social Media using Machine Learning","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8701408"},

  {"id":"tynerDefendGhettoSpace2006","abstract":"Founded in 1966 by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale as a grassroots organization, the Black Panther Party achieved national and international prominence through their local activities and global ideas. By employing the concepts of spaces of dependency and spaces of engagement, I detail the spatial transformations associated with the evolving political thought of the Black Panther Party. I chart how the four “moments” of the Black Panther Party's doctrine (black nationalism, revolutionary nationalism, revolutionary internationalism, and intercommunalism) are geographically contingent, and argue that these four moments demonstrate, both ideologically and materially, how space matters within the political thought of black radical intellectuals. Despite considerable work within geography in articulating alternative conceptions of race and racism, serious lacunae remain. The concepts associated with black separatism, black radical thought, and, crucially, the Black Power Movement have received minimal attention in the geographic literature. And yet fundamental geographic concepts, including territoriality and scalar politics, are key components of black separatism and black power. I argue that a case study of the Black Panther Party provides insights into the fundamental questions of social justice and public space.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Tyner","given":"James A."}],"container-title":"Annals of the Association of American Geographers","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-8306.2006.00501.x","ISSN":"0004-5608","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,3,1]]},"page":"105-118","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"“Defend the Ghetto”: Space and the Urban Politics of the Black Panther Party","title-short":"“Defend the Ghetto”","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8306.2006.00501.x","volume":"96"},

  {"id":"udupaExtremeSpeechGlobal2019","abstract":"In this article, we introduce the Special Section on Extreme Speech and Global Digital Cultures by developing the concept of “extreme speech.” In addressing the growing cultures of online vitriol and extremism, this concept advances a critical ethnographic sensibility to situated online speech cultures and a comparative global conversation that moves beyond the legal-normative debates that have been dominant in North America and Europe. We demonstrate this intervention by highlighting three interlinked arguments: Extreme speech inhabits a spectrum of practices rather than a binary opposition between acceptable and unacceptable speech; the sociotechnological aspects of new media embody a context in itself; and the violence of extreme speech acts is productive of identity in historically specific ways. This approach entails a methodological move that takes account of the meanings online users attach to vitriol as historical actors. It thus allows for critical frameworks to emerge from emic terms of action rather than moral concepts superimposed from the outside. Ethnographic explorations of extreme speech, we suggest, open up a new avenue to critique the contemporary global conjuncture of exclusionary politics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Udupa","given":"Sahana"},{"family":"Pohjonen","given":"Matti"}],"container-title":"International Journal of Communication","ISSN":"1932-8036","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,9]]},"language":"en","source":"ijoc.org","title":"Extreme Speech and Global Digital Cultures — Introduction","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/9102","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"uggenDemocraticContractionPolitical2002","abstract":"Universal suffrage is a cornerstone of democratic governance. As levels of criminal punishment have risen in the United States, however, an ever-larger number of citizens have lost the right to vote. The authors ask whether felon disenfranchisement constitutes a meaningful reversal of the extension of voting rights by considering its political impact. Data from legal sources, election studies, and inmate surveys are examined to consider two counterfactual conditions: (1) whether removing disenfranchisement restrictions alters the outcomes of past U.S. Senate and presidential elections, and (2) whether applying contemporary rates of disenfranchisement to prior elections affects their outcomes. Because felons are drawn disproportionately from the ranks of racial minorities and the poor, disenfranchisement laws tend to take more votes from Democratic than from Republican candidates. Analysis shows that felon disenfranchisement played a decisive role in U.S. Senate elections in recent years. Moreover, at least one Republican presidential victory would have been reversed if former felons had been allowed to vote, and at least one Democratic presidential victory would have been jeopardized had contemporary rates of disenfranchisement prevailed during that time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Uggen","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Manza","given":"Jeff"}],"container-title":"American Sociological Review","DOI":"10.2307/3088970","ISSN":"0003-1224","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002]]},"page":"777-803","source":"JSTOR","title":"Democratic Contraction?

As a consequence of its success, neo-roman republicanism also has achieved great prominence as the political tradition that delivered it. Yet despite the fact that liberty in the Roman mode was forged not only in direct confrontation with monarchy but against democracy as well, the relationship of republicanism to democracy is the great absentee in the contemporary debate on non-domination. This article brings that relationship back into view in both historical and conceptual terms. It illustrates the misrepresentations of democracy in the Roman tradition and shows how these undergirded the theory of liberty as non-domination as a counter to politial equality as a claim to taking part in imperium.

  {"id":"urbinatiLiquidPartiesDense2019","abstract":"Before proceeding, I would like to clarify briefly two interpretative premises, one methodological and one normative, which sustain my argument. Understanding the transformations facing constitutional democratic societies is a demanding task. These transformations, whose multiple causes are socio-economic not merely political, reflect on the one hand in the decline of mass party form of organization and on the other in the success of populism as not simply a movement of contestation but as a ruling power. In this article, I will suggest that the successes of populism are connected to the decline of organized parties, the pillar of constitutional democracy as it emerged after 1945. It is impossible to predict whether populism will succeed in becoming the new form of democracy. It is, however, certain that contemporary representative governments are facing astonishing mutations and the decline of the party form of representative unification of claims and ideas is one of them. My argument relies upon a phenomenology of populism as a movement that is strong in proportion as organized parties are weak, which actually capitalizes on a revolt against intermediary bodies such as parties.1","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Urbinati","given":"Nadia"}],"container-title":"Philosophy & Social Criticism","container-title-short":"Philosophy & Social Criticism","DOI":"10.1177/0191453719872274","ISSN":"0191-4537","issue":"9-10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1069-1083","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Liquid parties, dense populism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0191453719872274","volume":"45"},
  {"id":"urbinatiPoliticalTheoryPopulism2019","abstract":"Populism is the name of a global phenomenon whose definitional precariousness is proverbial. It resists generalizations and makes scholars of politics comparativist by necessity, as its language and content are imbued with the political culture of the society in which it arises. A rich body of socio-historical analyses allows us to situate populism within the global phenomenon called democracy, as its ideological core is nourished by the two main entities—the nation and the people—that have fleshed out popular sovereignty in the age of democratization. Populism consists in a transmutation of the democratic principles of the majority and the people in a way that is meant to celebrate one subset of the people as opposed to another, through a leader embodying it and an audience legitimizing it. This may make populism collide with constitutional democracy, even if its main tenets are embedded in the democratic universe of meanings and language. In this article, I illustrate the context-based character of populism and how its cyclical appearances reflect the forms of representative government. I review the main contemporary interpretations of the concept and argue that some basic agreement now exists on populism's rhetorical character and its strategy for achieving power in democratic societies. Finally, I sketch the main characteristics of populism in power and explain how it tends to transform the fundamentals of democracy: the people and the majority, elections, and representation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Urbinati","given":"Nadia"}],"container-title":"Annual Review of Political Science","DOI":"10.1146/annurev-polisci-050317-070753","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"page":"111-127","source":"Annual Reviews","title":"Political Theory of Populism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-polisci-050317-070753","volume":"22"},
  {"id":"urbinatiUnpoliticalDemocracy2010","abstract":"This paper analyzes critically the appeal the unpolitical is enjoying among contemporary political philosophers who are democracy's friends. Unlike a radical critique of democracy, what I propose to call \"criticism from within,\" takes the form of dissatisfaction with the erosion of an independent mind and impartial judgment per effect of the partisan character of democratic politics. This paper proposes three main criticisms of the actual trend toward unpolitical views of democracy: the first points to the strategic use of deliberation as an antidote against democratic procedures themselves (like voting and majority rule); the second to the negative conception of democracy that the unpolitical aspiration makes visible; and the third to the dissolution of political judgment within a model of judgment that is tailored around justice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Urbinati","given":"Nadia"}],"container-title":"Political Theory","ISSN":"0090-5917","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"page":"65-92","source":"JSTOR","title":"Unpolitical Democracy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/25655533","volume":"38"},
  {"id":"urinboyevLawSocialNorms2011","abstract":"Despite numerous challenges, since its independence, Uzbekistan, with the exception of the May 2005 Andijan events, has enjoyed extraordinary political stability and not recorded any considerable cases of interethnic or interfaith conflict, regime change or civil war, whereas neighboring Kyrgyzstan, labeled an “island of democracy” by the Western world, has experienced numerous conflicts and chaos, ranging from “color revolutions” to ethnic conflict. However, for understanding Uzbekistan’s ability to cope with internal and external challenges, little recourse is made to the post-independence discourse on public administration known as “mahalla reforms”. In spite of the significant existing body of literature on the mahalla, there has been little systematic scholarly investigation of the role of mahalla in maintaining political stability and security in Uzbekistan. Previous studies did not provide an account of how the law, social norms and welfare come to interplay in the mahalla system and how this influences the public administration developments in Uzbekistan. This paper begins to redress this lacuna by analyzing public-administration reforms in post-independence Uzbekistan, namely mahalla reforms, with an effort to show how political and social stability is established through mahalla, and to what extent those reforms have affected the position of individuals vis-à-vis the publicadministration system. In undertaking this task, the paper employs three theoretical concepts: the theory of norms, the welfare-pentagon model and the theory of social control. In this paper, I argue that public-administration reforms since 1991 have transformed mahalla into a comprehensive system of social control; and therefore, mahalla can be places of democratic involvement or sites of authoritarianism in Uzbekistan.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Urinboyev","given":"Rustamjon"}],"container-title":"NISPAcee Journal of Public Administration and Policy","DOI":"10.2478/v10110-011-0002-8","ISSN":"1337-9038","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"33-57","source":"Crossref","title":"Law, Social Norms and Welfare as Means of Public Administration: Case Study of Mahalla Institutions in Uzbekistan","title-short":"Law, Social Norms and Welfare as Means of Public Administration","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/nispa/4/1/article-p33.xml","volume":"4"},

The key evidence cited in support of this belief are meta-analyses of multisection studies showing small-to-moderate correlations between SET ratings and student achievement (e.g., Cohen, 1980, Cohen, 1981; Feldman, 1989). We re-analyzed previously published meta-analyses of the multisection studies and found that their findings were an artifact of small sample sized studies and publication bias. Whereas the small sample sized studies showed large and moderate correlation, the large sample sized studies showed no or only minimal correlation between SET ratings and learning. Our up-to-date meta-analysis of all multisection studies revealed no significant correlations between the SET ratings and learning.

  {"id":"uttlNumbersTellIt2013","abstract":"Undergraduate Students' interest in taking quantitative vs. non quantitative courses has received limited attention even though it has important consequences for higher education. Previous studies have collected course interest ratings at the end of the courses as part of student evaluation of teaching (SET) ratings, which may confound prior interest in taking these courses with students' actual experience in taking them. This study is the first to examine undergraduate students' interest in quantitative vs. non quantitative courses in their first year of studies before they have taken any quantitative courses. Three hundred and forty students were presented with descriptions of 44 psychology courses and asked to rate their interest in taking each course. Student interest in taking quantitative vs non quantitative courses was very low; the mean interest in statistics courses was nearly 6 SDs below the mean interest in non quantitative courses. Moreover, women were less interested in taking quantitative courses than men. Our findings have several far-reaching implications. First, evaluating professors teaching quantitative vs. non quantitative courses against the same SET standard may be inappropriate. Second, if the same SET standard is used for the evaluation of faculty teaching quantitative vs. non quantitative courses, faculty are likely to teach to SETs rather than focus on student learning. Third, universities interested primarily in student satisfaction may want to expunge quantitative courses from their curricula. In contrast, universities interested in student learning may want to abandon SETs as a primary measure of faculty teaching effectiveness. Fourth, undergraduate students who are not interested in taking quantitative courses are unlikely to pursue graduate studies in quantitative psychology and unlikely to be able to competently analyze data independently.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Uttl","given":"Bob"},{"family":"White","given":"Carmela A."},{"family":"Morin","given":"Alain"}],"container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0083443","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,12,16]]},"language":"en","page":"e83443","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"The Numbers Tell It All: Students Don't Like Numbers!","title-short":"The Numbers Tell It All","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0083443","volume":"8"},

Of course, none of that was part of the plan. In Antisocial Media, Siva Vaidhyanathan explains how Facebook devolved from an innocent social site hacked together by Harvard students into a force that, while it may make personal life just a little more pleasurable, makes democracy a lot more challenging. It's an account of the hubris of good intentions, a missionary spirit, and an ideology that sees computer code as the universal solvent for all human problems. And it's an indictment of how \"social media\" has fostered the deterioration of democratic culture around the world, from facilitating Russian meddling in support of Trump's election to the exploitation of the platform by murderous authoritarians in Burma and the Philippines. Facebook grew out of an ideological commitment to data-driven decision making and logical thinking. Its culture is explicitly tolerant of difference and dissent. Both its market orientation and its labor force are global. It preaches the power of connectivity to change lives for the better. Indeed, no company better represents the dream of a fully connected planet \"sharing\" words, ideas, and images, and no company has better leveraged those ideas into wealth and influence. Yet no company has contributed more to the global collapse of basic tenets of deliberation and democracy. Both authoritative and trenchant, Antisocial Media shows how Facebook's mission went so wrong.","author":[{"family":"Vaidhyanathan","given":"Siva"}],"ISBN":"978-0-19-084118-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,15]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"289","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Antisocial Media: How Facebook Disconnects Us and Undermines Democracy","title-short":"Antisocial Media","type":"book"},

  {"id":"valentiniDignityHumanRights2017","abstract":"Human rights are often defined as entitlements that human beings possess just by virtue of their inherent dignity. This conceptual link between human rights and inherent dignity is as popular as it is unhelpful. It invites metaphysical disputes about what, exactly, endows human beings with inherent dignity, and distracts from the core function of human rights: placing constraints on powerful actors, especially states. In response to this difficulty, I reconceptualise the relationship between human rights and dignity in a way that maximally serves human rights’ purpose. I do so by distinguishing between ‘inherent dignity’ and ‘status dignity’, and by linking human rights to the latter, not the former. First, I argue that human rights articulate standards for respecting the status dignity of the subjects of sovereign authority, rather than the inherent dignity of human beings qua humans. Secondly, I suggest that not only individuals but also corporate agents possess status dignity. In particular, states that violate human rights lose their status dignity, thereby becoming liable to interference.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Valentini","given":"Laura"}],"container-title":"Oxford Journal of Legal Studies","DOI":"10.1093/ojls/gqx011","ISSN":"0143-6503, 1464-3820","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"862-885","source":"Crossref","title":"Dignity and Human Rights: A Reconceptualisation","title-short":"Dignity and Human Rights","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://academic.oup.com/ojls/article/37/4/862/4061560","volume":"37"},

A broadbased, multi-stakeholder organization could develop and implement this private fairness doctrine, and the certification process could harness market and social pressure to influence the practices of traditional and new media firms. A growing literature demonstrates how private governance initiatives can perform the functions of government in the environmental, labor, gun control, animal welfare, fair trade, and other areas. The Essay argues that private governance initiatives such as the new private fairness doctrine also can bolster the social checks and balances that support the processes of democratic governance. Any intervention into the flow of information creates risks, but so does inaction, and the private fairness doctrine holds out the possibility of improving the information available for public discourse while limiting the risks of government intervention. In the long term, the concept of private governance also can stimulate creative thinking on interventions to improve other core democratic processes, including campaign finance, voting, ballot security, and others.","author":[{"family":"Vandenbergh","given":"Professor Michael"}],"language":"en","page":"41","source":"Zotero","title":"Social Checks and Balances: A Private Fairness Doctrine Vanderbilt Law Review, Forthcoming","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"vandergraafNavigatingPlatformUrbanism2019","abstract":"The smart city imaginary has become a recurring theme within critical urban geography and entails a distinct set of rationalities. Here, we are interested in grappling with the current ‘place’ of smart cities in the context of what seems to be an emerging platform urbanism, thereby highlighting a complex platform-based ecosystem encompassing private and public organisations and citizens. Our point of departure is the operationalization of three intertwined trends associated with the conceptualizations of participation, mediatisation and (multi-sided) platformisation. Through the examination of (social) traffic and navigation application, Waze, we explore manifestations of (contested) dynamics in mobility practices occurring between commerce and community in the public space of the city. The preliminary findings point to the emergence of new socio-spatial constructs which afford a better frame of ‘what is going on’, challenging the smart city framework as a planning and development paradigm. In putting forward the notion of public value and ownership, it is our aim to prompt a critical debate about platform urbanism made explicit by a driving politics that offers a window to a future driving world, urging cities and governments to anticipate and mitigate (un)intended consequences.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Graaf","given":"Shenja","non-dropping-particle":"van der"},{"family":"Ballon","given":"Pieter"}],"collection-title":"Understanding Smart Cities: Innovation ecosystems, technological advancements, and societal challenges","container-title":"Technological Forecasting and Social Change","container-title-short":"Technological Forecasting and Social Change","DOI":"10.1016/j.techfore.2018.07.027","ISSN":"0040-1625","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"364-372","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Navigating platform urbanism","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162517318528","volume":"142"},

Taking the Airbnb Citizen advocacy initiative as my case, I examine how this transnational “home sharing” platform achieves such transformations, which in turn requires an investigation into the specific nature of Airbnb as an institutional form. Assuming the agenda-setting role of the urban “regulatory entrepreneur,” Airbnb aims to co-shape the terms of current and future policy debates pertaining not just to home sharing/short-term rental but also to the very fabric of city life. It pursues this mode of “platform urbanism” by mobilizing its user base, which it frames as a community of entrepreneurial middle-class citizens looking to supplement their income in a climate of economic insecurity and tech-enabled opportunity.

After receiving allegations of defamatory content in top search results, Google must decide between protecting one person’s public image and another’s profits or speech. Amazon adjudicates disputes between consumers and third-party merchants about defective or counterfeit items. For many small businesses, layoffs and bankruptcy hang in the balance. This Article uncovers the processes that these platforms use to resolve disputes, and proposes reforms. Other powerful businesses that intermediate, such as credit card companies ruling on a disputed charge between a merchant and consumer, must by federal law provide timely notice, a reasonable investigation, and other procedural minimums. In contrast, platforms have almost unfettered discretion. Under intense public pressure, Facebook recently began building an independent oversight board that can overrule content moderation decisions. But whether other platforms will follow is unclear, and Facebook’s oversight board has significant limits. If platforms are to continue as the primary arbiters of disputes in the information age, they warrant mandated procedures as did financial institutions before them. The procedures would aim to improve the administration of justice through public accountability and separation of at least one of platforms’ executive, legislative, and judicial powers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Van Loo","given":"Rory"}],"event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,15]]},"language":"en","number":"ID 3576562","publisher":"Social Science Research Network","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"papers.ssrn.com","title":"Federal Rules of Platform Procedure","type":"report","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3576562"},

  {"id":"vanlooREGULATORYMONITORSPOLICING2019","abstract":"Like police officers patrolling the streets for crime, the front lines for most large business regulators—Environmental Protection Agency engineers, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau examiners, and Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspectors, among others—decide when and how to enforce the law. These regulatory monitors guard against toxic air, financial ruin, and deadly explosions. Yet whereas scholars devote considerable attention to police officers in criminal law enforcement, they have paid limited attention to the structural role of regulatory monitors in civil law enforcement. This Article is the first to chronicle the statutory rise of regulatory monitors and to situate them empirically at the core of modern administrative power. Since the Civil War, often in response to crises, the largest federal regulators have steadily accrued authority to collect documents remotely and enter private spaces without any suspicion of wrongdoing. Those exercising this monitoring authority within agencies administer the law at least as much as the groups that are the focus of legal scholarship: enforcement lawyers, administrative law judges, and rule writers. Regulatory monitors wield sanctions, influence rulemaking, and create quasi-common law. Moreover, they offer a better fit than lawyers for the modern era of “collaborative governance” and corporate compliance departments because their principal function—information collection—is less adversarial. Yet unlike litigation and rulemaking, monitoring-based decisions are largely unobservable by the public, often unreviewable by courts, and explicitly excluded by the Administrative Procedure Act. The regulatory-monitor function can thus be more easily ramped up or deconstructed by the President, interest groups, and agency directors. A better understanding of regulatory monitors—and their relationship with regulatory lawyers—is vital to designing democratic accountability not only during times of political transition but as long as they remain a central pillar of the administrative state.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,1]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Van Loo","given":"Rory"}],"container-title":"Columbia Law Review","ISSN":"0010-1958","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"page":"369-444","publisher":"Columbia Law Review Association, Inc.","source":"JSTOR","title":"REGULATORY MONITORS: POLICING FIRMS IN THE COMPLIANCE ERA","title-short":"REGULATORY MONITORS","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/26651844","volume":"119"},

It argues that Ackerman’s version of democratic dualism sets strict normative distinctions between constitutional and ordinary political deliberations. As a result, it ignores everyday political processes and citizens’ ordinary public deliberations and is unresponsive to ongoing social changes in a liberal pluralist society. On the other hand, Habermas’s discursive constitution defends a dynamic relationship between constitutional and ordinary politics. It provides a better model of a continuous constitutional development that is more open to new social and historical circumstances.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Vargova","given":"Mariela"}],"container-title":"Ratio Juris","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-9337.2005.00303.x","ISSN":"1467-9337","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"365-86","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Democratic Deficits of a Dualist Deliberative Constitutionalism: Bruce Ackerman and Jürgen Habermas","title-short":"Democratic Deficits of a Dualist Deliberative Constitutionalism","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9337.2005.00303.x","volume":"18"},
  {"id":"varolEarlyDetectionPromoted2017","abstract":"Social media expose millions of users every day to information campaigns - some emerging organically from grassroots activity, others sustained by advertising or other coordinated efforts. These campaigns contribute to the shaping of collective opinions. While most information campaigns are benign, some may be deployed for nefarious purposes, including terrorist propaganda, political astroturf, and financial market manipulation. It is therefore important to be able to detect whether a meme is being artificially promoted at the very moment it becomes wildly popular. This problem has important social implications and poses numerous technical challenges. As a first step, here we focus on discriminating between trending memes that are either organic or promoted by means of advertisement. The classification is not trivial: ads cause bursts of attention that can be easily mistaken for those of organic trends. We designed a machine learning framework to classify memes that have been labeled as trending on Twitter. After trending, we can rely on a large volume of activity data. Early detection, occurring immediately at trending time, is a more challenging problem due to the minimal volume of activity data that is available prior to trending. Our supervised learning framework exploits hundreds of time-varying features to capture changing network and diffusion patterns, content and sentiment information, timing signals, and user meta-data. We explore different methods for encoding feature time series. Using millions of tweets containing trending hashtags, we achieve 75% AUC score for early detection, increasing to above 95% after trending. We evaluate the robustness of the algorithms by introducing random temporal shifts on the trend time series. Feature selection analysis reveals that content cues provide consistently useful signals; user features are more informative for early detection, while network and timing features are more helpful once more data is available.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Varol","given":"Onur"},{"family":"Ferrara","given":"Emilio"},{"family":"Menczer","given":"Filippo"},{"family":"Flammini","given":"Alessandro"}],"container-title":"EPJ Data Science","DOI":"10.1140/epjds/s13688-017-0111-y","ISSN":"2193-1127","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,12]]},"language":"En","page":"13","source":"epjdatascience.springeropen.com","title":"Early detection of promoted campaigns on social media","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://epjdatascience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1140/epjds/s13688-017-0111-y","volume":"6"},

Under this “new authoritarian” regime, a growing number of Russians are investigated by the security services or put on trial for high treason. NGOs face selective prosecution and surprise inspections. While we know how lawyers use legal mobilization in democratic regimes where they can expect courts to be fair, legal mobilization remains understudied in regimes moving toward authoritarianism, where authorities pass repressive laws but enforce them erratically. Drawing on interviews with Russian lawyers, this article examines how lawyers represent two victim groups of state coercion: Russians under investigation for treason and prosecuted human rights NGOs. By examining how lawyers make strategic choices while coping with unfair courts, the random enforcement of laws, and shrinking resources, this article argues that state coercion does not deter lawyers from legal mobilization at domestic courts and the European Court of Human Rights. Instead, repressive laws push lawyers to reinvent their everyday practices to counter repressive legislation and conviction bias in the criminal justice system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Vet","given":"Freek","dropping-particle":"van der"}],"container-title":"Law & Society Review","DOI":"10.1111/lasr.12339","ISSN":"1540-5893","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","page":"301-336","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"“When They Come for You”: Legal Mobilization in New Authoritarian Russia","title-short":"“When They Come for You”","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/lasr.12339","volume":"52"},

  {"id":"vinxErnstWolfgangBockenfordePolitics2019","abstract":"It is often held that the legitimacy of a democratic constitution depends on its production by constituent power. This paper argues that the notion of legitimation by constituent power faces a dilemma: if the authenticity of an exercise of constituent power depends on conformity to existing constitutional law or on requirements of justice that are antecedent to the actual process of constitution-making, the appeal to constituent power must lack the paramount normative significance that theorists of constituent power attribute to it. Defenders of constituent power typically respond to this problem by radicalising the notion of constituent power. But if exercises of constituent power are to be unbound from all antecedent normativity, it is argued here, they cannot legitimate the constitutional product. This case against excessively strong conceptions of popular sovereignty is developed through a critical discussion of Ernst-Wolfgang Böckenförde’s and Carl Schmitt’s theories of constituent power.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Vinx","given":"Lars"}],"container-title":"Jurisprudence","DOI":"10.1080/20403313.2018.1442257","ISSN":"2040-3313","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,2]]},"page":"15-38","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Ernst-Wolfgang Böckenförde and the politics of constituent power","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/20403313.2018.1442257","volume":"10"},

This understanding of slavery essentially goes back to Aristotle’s theory of natural slavery. An examination of the Greek vocabulary of slavery though shows that the vast majority of Greeks had a very different understanding of slavery as a relationship of domination. This article argues that this alternative Greek understanding of slavery can account for some serious conundrums in Greek attitudes and thought, and explains the reasons behind Aristotle’s reformulation of slavery as a relationship of property.

However, its origin in the social sciences belies the effectiveness of its interdisciplinary ambitions and undermines its ability to cope with ecological complexity. To narrow the gap between inherently dynamic ecological systems and the SES framework, we need to explicitly recognize that SES outcomes are coproduced by social systems in which choices are made, as well as an ecological system with a diverse assortment of dynamic natural processes that mediate the effect of those choices. We illustrate the need for more explicit incorporation of ecological attributes into the SES framework by presenting a case study of a community-managed forest in Indiana, USA. A preliminary set of ecological attributes are also proposed for inclusion in the SES framework with the aim of spurring interest in further development of a truly interdisciplinary framework for the study of SESs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Vogt","given":"Jessica M."},{"family":"Epstein","given":"Graham B."},{"family":"Mincey","given":"Sarah K."},{"family":"Fischer","given":"Burnell C."},{"family":"McCord","given":"Paul"}],"container-title":"Ecology and Society","DOI":"10.5751/ES-07239-200155","ISSN":"1708-3087","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"language":"en","source":"Crossref","title":"Putting the \"E\" in SES: unpacking the ecology in the Ostrom social-ecological system framework","title-short":"Putting the \"E\" in SES","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol20/iss1/art55/","volume":"20"},

To understand how false news spreads, Vosoughi et al. used a data set of rumor cascades on Twitter from 2006 to 2017. About 126,000 rumors were spread by ∼3 million people. False news reached more people than the truth; the top 1% of false news cascades diffused to between 1000 and 100,000 people, whereas the truth rarely diffused to more than 1000 people. Falsehood also diffused faster than the truth. The degree of novelty and the emotional reactions of recipients may be responsible for the differences observed.\nScience, this issue p. 1146\nWe investigated the differential diffusion of all of the verified true and false news stories distributed on Twitter from 2006 to 2017. The data comprise ~126,000 stories tweeted by ~3 million people more than 4.5 million times. We classified news as true or false using information from six independent fact-checking organizations that exhibited 95 to 98% agreement on the classifications. Falsehood diffused significantly farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in all categories of information, and the effects were more pronounced for false political news than for false news about terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends, or financial information. We found that false news was more novel than true news, which suggests that people were more likely to share novel information. Whereas false stories inspired fear, disgust, and surprise in replies, true stories inspired anticipation, sadness, joy, and trust. Contrary to conventional wisdom, robots accelerated the spread of true and false news at the same rate, implying that false news spreads more than the truth because humans, not robots, are more likely to spread it.\nA large-scale analysis of tweets reveals that false rumors spread further and faster than the truth.\nA large-scale analysis of tweets reveals that false rumors spread further and faster than the truth.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Vosoughi","given":"Soroush"},{"family":"Roy","given":"Deb"},{"family":"Aral","given":"Sinan"}],"container-title":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.aap9559","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"6380","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,9]]},"language":"en","page":"1146-1151","PMID":"29590045","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","section":"Report","source":"science-sciencemag-org.proxy.lib.uiowa.edu","title":"The spread of true and false news online","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6380/1146","volume":"359"},

We use a nationally-representative sample to investigate the relationship between news literacy (NL), seeing and posting news and political content on social media, and skepticism toward information shared on social media. This study finds NL and related orientations contribute to who is seeing and sharing information on social media, with those who are more knowledgeable about media structures seeing and sharing less content. Moreover, those who are more news literate and value NL are more skeptical of information quality on social media.

Olson clearly shows that large groups have a tendency not to be formed unless they provide some divisible service for its members; consequently, existing group theorizing is often erroneous.

Even the sometimes unfavorable comments about his inadequate consideration of the institutions through which individuals interact would remain unthought without Olson's provocation. After all, he was primarily concerned about the inability to achieve large-group organization; implications for the advancement of group interests were secondary.

To answer this, we draw upon data from seventy-one in-depth interviews in Chicago, Philadelphia, and Miami. We found that perceptions about the overall media ecosystem were characterized by a: a) negative view of the current quality of news reporting, b) particular distrust of news circulation on social media; and c) concern about the effects of these trends mainly on the information habits of others. To counter these perceptions, participants indicated to rely on: a) traditional fact-based media, accompanied by a rejection of opinionated outlets; b) personal experience and knowledge; c) repetition of information across outlets; d) consumption of cross-ideological sources; e) fact-checking; and f) trust in certain personal contacts on social media, who are perceived as assessors of news quality. Our findings suggest that: a) news consumption is being ritualized in new and more personalized ways; b) social media is seen as a gateway to news partly because audiences find opinion leaders in terms of their skills as credibility assessors; and c) journalism could cater more to audiences’ demands for more fact-oriented and less discussion-based content.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Wagner","given":"María Celeste"},{"family":"Boczkowski","given":"Pablo J."}],"container-title":"Digital Journalism","DOI":"10.1080/21670811.2019.1653208","ISSN":"2167-0811","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,9]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/21670811.2019.1653208","page":"870-885","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The Reception of Fake News: The Interpretations and Practices That Shape the Consumption of Perceived Misinformation","title-short":"The Reception of Fake News","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/21670811.2019.1653208","volume":"7"},

This Article seeks to identify the building blocks of safe social spaces, or environments in which individuals can share personal information at low risk of privacy threats. Relying on analogies to offline social spaces—Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, teams of coworkers, and attorney-client relationships—this Article argues that if a social space is defined as an environment characterized by disclosure, then a safe social space is one in which disclosure norms are counterbalanced by equally as powerful norms of trust that are both endogenously designed in and backed exogenously by law. Case studies of online social networks and social robots are used to show how both the design and law governing technosocial spaces today not only do not support trust, but actively undermine user safety by eroding trust and limiting the law’s regulatory power.

This article seeks to place the study of democratic backsliding on sturdier conceptual, operational, and theoretical foundations. Conceptually, the challenge of backsliding is to deﬁne changes that take place within a political regime. Methodologically, the challenge involves measurement of intraregime changes, as alternative coding schemes change the population of units that have experienced democratic backsliding. Theoretical challenges are dual: First, despite a rich and diverse literature, we lack readily available theories to explain backsliding, and second, the theoretical debates that do exist—centered on the causes of democratic transitions, democratic breakdowns, authoritarian resilience, and democratic consolidation—remain unresolved. We consider how these theories might be called into service to explain backsliding. By doing so, the article aims to set the terms of the debate to create a common focal point around which research can coalesce.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Waldner","given":"David"},{"family":"Lust","given":"Ellen"}],"container-title":"Annual Review of Political Science","DOI":"10.1146/annurev-polisci-050517-114628","ISSN":"1094-2939, 1545-1577","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,11]]},"language":"en","page":"93-113","source":"Crossref","title":"Unwelcome Change: Coming to Terms with Democratic Backsliding","title-short":"Unwelcome Change","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-polisci-050517-114628","volume":"21"},

  {"id":"waldronCoreCaseJudicial2006","abstract":"This Essay states the general case against judicial review of legislation clearly and in a way that is uncluttered by discussions of particular decisions or the history of its emergence in particular systems of constitutional law. The Essay criticizes judicial review on two main grounds. First, it argues that there is no reason to suppose that rights are better protected by this practice than they would be by democratic legislatures. Second, it argues that, quite apart from the outcomes it generates, judicial review is democratically illegitimate. The second argument is familiar; the first argument less so. However, the case against judicial review is not absolute or unconditional. In this Essay, it is premised on a number of conditions, including that the society in question has good working democratic institutions and that most of its citizens take rights seriously (even if they may disagree about what rights they have). The Essay ends by considering what follows from the failure of these conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Waldron","given":"Jeremy"}],"container-title":"The Yale Law Journal","DOI":"10.2307/20455656","ISSN":"0044-0094","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006]]},"page":"1346-1406","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Core of the Case Against Judicial Review","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/20455656","volume":"115"},

  {"id":"waldronDignityRankRights2012","abstract":"Writers on human dignity roughly divide between those who stress the social origins of this concept and its role in marking rank and hierarchy, and those who follow Kant in grounding dignity in an abstract and idealized philosophical conception of human beings. In these lectures, Jeremy Waldron contrives to combine attractive features of both strands. In the first lecture, Waldron presents a conception of dignity that preserves its ancient association with rank and station, thus allowing him to tap rich historical resources while avoiding what many perceive as the excessive abstraction and dubious metaphysics of the Kantian strand. At the same time he argues for a conception of human dignity that amounts to a generalization of high status across all human beings, and so attains the appealing universality of the Kantian position. The second lecture focuses particularly on the importance of dignity - understood in this way - as a status defining persons' relation to law: their presentation as persons capable of self-applying the law, capable of presenting and arguing a point of view, and capable of responding to law's demands without brute coercion. Together the two lectures illuminate the relation between dignity conceived as the ground of rights and dignity conceived as the content of rights; they also illuminate important ideas about dignity as noble bearing and dignity as the subject of a right against degrading treatment; and they help us understand the sense in which dignity is better conceived as a status than as a kind of value.","author":[{"family":"Waldron","given":"Jeremy"}],"ISBN":"0-19-997718-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"number-of-pages":"176","publisher":"Oxford University Press","title":"Dignity, Rank, and Rights","title-short":"Dignity, Rank, and Rights","type":"book","URL":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6zws3ZQO6dAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=waldron+dignity+rank+and+rights&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api"},

  {"id":"waldronFiveFourWhy","abstract":"Courts, such as the U.S. Supreme Court, make important decisions about rights by voting, and often the decision is determined by a bare majority. But the principle of majority decision (MD) for courts has not been much reflected on. There is very little scholarly literature on this and only a handful of articles proposing alternatives to MD in the judicial context. So what justifies judges' reliance on MD? In democratic contexts, MD is usually defended on one of three grounds: (i) as a decision-procedure that is efficient; (ii) as a way of reaching the objectively best decision; or (iii) as a way of respecting the principle of political equality. However, it is difficult to see how any of these arguments really explains or justifies MD in the case of judicial decision-making. Regarding (i), other efficient procedures are available: we want to know why this sort of efficiency should be valued. On (ii), epistemic arguments for MD do not work well for the sort of bare majorities that we see in Supreme Court decision-making. And, on (iii), it is hard to rig up an argument based on political equality or political fairness that works for unelected judges as opposed to ordinary citizens or their elected representatives. After reflecting on these possibilities, the Essay concludes that, at the very least, defenders of judicial authority should be more tentative in their denunciations of democratic majoritarianism.","author":[{"family":"Waldron","given":"Jeremy"}],"language":"en","page":"41","source":"Zotero","title":"Five to Four: Why Do Bare Majorities Rule on Courts?","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"walkerDisinformationLandscapeLockdown2019","abstract":"This introduction to the special issue considers how independent research on mis/disinformation campaigns can be conducted in a corporate environment hostile to academic research. We provide an overview of the disinformation landscape in the wake of the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal and social platforms’ decision to enforce access lockdowns and the throttling of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for data collection. We argue that the governance shift from user communities to social media algorithms, along with social platforms’ intensive emphasis on generating revenue from user data, has eroded the mutual trust of networked publics and opened the way for dis/misinformation campaigns. We discuss the importance of open, public APIs for academic research as well as the unique challenges of collecting social media data to study highly ephemeral mis/disinformation campaigns. The introduction concludes with an assessment of the growing data access gap that not only hinders research of public interest, but that may also preclude researchers from identifying meaningful research questions as activity on social platforms becomes increasingly more inscrutable and unobservable.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Walker","given":"Shawn"},{"family":"Mercea","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Bastos","given":"Marco"}],"container-title":"Information, Communication & Society","DOI":"10.1080/1369118X.2019.1648536","ISSN":"1369-118X","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,19]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2019.1648536","page":"1531-1543","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The disinformation landscape and the lockdown of social platforms","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2019.1648536","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"walterRussianTwitterAccounts2020","abstract":"Objectives. To understand how Twitter accounts operated by the Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA) discussed vaccines to increase the credibility of their manufactured personas.Methods. We analyzed 2.82 million tweets published by 2689 IRA accounts between 2015 and 2017. Combining unsupervised machine learning and network analysis to identify “thematic personas” (i.e., accounts that consistently share the same topics), we analyzed the ways in which each discussed vaccines.Results. We found differences in volume and valence of vaccine-related tweets among 9 thematic personas. Pro-Trump personas were more likely to express antivaccine sentiment. Anti-Trump personas expressed support for vaccination. Others offered a balanced valence, talked about vaccines neutrally, or did not tweet about vaccines.Conclusions. IRA-operated accounts discussed vaccines in manners consistent with fabricated US identities.Public Health Implications. IRA accounts discussed vaccines online in ways that evoked political identities. This could exacerbate recently emerging partisan gaps relating to vaccine misinformation, as differently valenced messages were targeted at different segments of the US public. These sophisticated targeting efforts, if repeated and increased in reach, could reduce vaccination rates and magnify health disparities. (Am J Public Health.

  {"id":"wangContainingMisinformationSpreading2019","abstract":"Many researchers from a variety of fields including computer science, network science and mathematics have focused on how to contain the outbreaks of Internet misinformation that threaten social systems and undermine societal health. Most research on this topic treats the connections among individuals as static, but these connections change in time, and thus social networks are also temporal networks. Currently there is no theoretical approach to the problem of containing misinformation outbreaks in temporal networks. We thus propose a misinformation spreading model for temporal networks and describe it using a new theoretical approach. We propose a heuristic-containing (HC) strategy based on optimizing final outbreak size that outperforms simplified strategies such as those that are random-containing (RC) and targeted-containing (TC). We verify the effectiveness of our HC strategy on both artificial and real-world networks by performing extensive numerical simulations and theoretical analyses. We find that the HC strategy greatly increases the outbreak threshold and decreases the final outbreak threshold.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Yuanhui"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Tao"},{"family":"Dai","given":"Yang"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Xingshu"},{"family":"Braunstein","given":"Lidia A."}],"container-title":"arXiv:1904.10801 [physics]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,24]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Containing misinformation spreading in temporal social networks","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10801"},
  {"id":"wangEmpoweringPoliceHow2014","abstract":"How does the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) secure the loyalty of its coercive leaders, and its public security chiefs in particular, in the face of numerous domestic protests every year? This article presents the first quantitative analysis of contemporary China’s coercive leaders using an original data set of provincial public security chiefs and public security funding during the reform era. I demonstrate that the CCP, owing to its concern for regime stability, has empowered the public security chiefs by incorporating them into the leadership team. Empowered public security chiefs then have stronger bargaining power over budgetary issues. I rely on fieldwork, qualitative interviews and an analysis of Party documents to complement my statistical analysis. The findings of this analysis shed light on the understanding of regime durability, contentious politics and the bureaucracy in China.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Yuhua"}],"container-title":"The China Quarterly","DOI":"10.1017/S0305741014000769","ISSN":"0305-7410, 1468-2648","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,9]]},"language":"en","page":"625-648","source":"Crossref","title":"Empowering the Police: How the Chinese Communist Party Manages Its Coercive Leaders","title-short":"Empowering the Police","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0305741014000769/type/journal_article","volume":"219"},
  {"id":"wangLocalProtectionismChina2016","abstract":"This article presents a large-scale, systematic study of politically connected firms in China. It was conducted by compiling a database of all the publicly traded firms in China in 1993, 2002 and 2012 that codes the biographies of hundreds of thousands of board members. I find that there has been a significant increase in the percentage of firms that are connected with the national government in the last 20 years. This casts doubt on a popular argument that businesses in China have primarily relied on “local protectionism.” I interpret this as a result of firms' need to connect with powerful and stable institutions. I test this by examining the impact of the fall of Chen Liangyu on firms in Shanghai.\n, \n本文通过中国上市公司 1993, 2002 和 2012 年全部董事会成员简历的数据考察当代中国政企关系的变化。我发现, 在过去的 20 年中, 与中央政府有关联的企业比例显著增加。这一结果有悖于中国企业主要依靠 “地方保护主义” 的流行说法。我认为这一趋势反应了企业与强势和稳定的政治机构建立关联的需要。对陈良宇撤职后上海上市公司的事件分析对这一看法提供了证据。","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Yuhua"}],"container-title":"The China Quarterly","DOI":"10.1017/S030574101600031X","ISSN":"0305-7410, 1468-2648","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,6]]},"language":"en","page":"319-341","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Beyond Local Protectionism: China's State–Business Relations in the Last Two Decades","title-short":"Beyond Local Protectionism","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/china-quarterly/article/beyond-local-protectionism-chinas-statebusiness-relations-in-the-last-two-decades/EABD0F1DD2BF72C451F9C940416D847A","volume":"226"},

  {"id":"wanlessAudienceAmplifierParticipatory2019","abstract":"Propaganda is changing in a Digital Age. What once was a top-down effort to the masses has through the internet become a participatory affair. As people increasingly “plug-in” to online services, a wealth of personal data aggregated by internet giants facilitates the creation and distribution of tailored provocative messaging, which savvy propagandists then push through online communities to unsuspecting target audiences who help spread persuasive content further. In this dynamic information environment, audiences are no longer passive consumers of persuasive content. Instead, they are active agents who participate in its creation, spread and amplification, inadvertently furthering the agenda of propagandists whose messaging resonates with their world view. Propagandists achieve this through behavioural advertising, manipulating internet algorithms, targeting and provoking online echo chambers and communities, and winning traditional media coverage. Often such efforts blur the lines between what is real and what isn’t, when staged activities are obfuscated through astroturfing or botnet amplification to look like an authentic engagement by ordinary users. These methods, alongside the pervasiveness of modern communications in our lives, create ample opportunities for skilled propagandists to set agendas for and influence national political dynamics or policy choices. This chapter explores the emergence of participatory propaganda, drawing from a model first identified during the US 2016 presidential election and subsequently found in online political activity in the UK and Canada using social network and content analysis.","author":[{"family":"Wanless","given":"Alicia"},{"family":"Berk","given":"Michael"}],"container-title":"The SAGE Handbook of Propaganda","editor":[{"family":"Baines","given":"Paul"},{"family":"O'Shaughnessy","given":"Nicholas"},{"family":"Snow","given":"Nancy"}],"ISBN":"978-1-5264-8623-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,25]]},"language":"en","publisher":"SAGE","source":"Google Books","title":"The Audience is the Amplifier: Participatory Propaganda","type":"chapter"},
  {"id":"wardakBuildingPostwarJustice2004","abstract":"This paper examines key dimensions of justice in post-war Afghanistan. These are shari’a (Islamic law), traditional institutions of informal justice (jirga), the Afghan interim legal framework, and human rights principles. It is argued that despite their apparent incompatibility, these various dimensions of justice could be integrated within a coherent framework of a new justice system in post-war Afghanistan – a framework that would promote interaction between local institutions of informal justice and a district level court of justice, on the one hand, and between these two and a proposed human rights unit, on the other. On the basis of this analysis, an experimental model of a system of justice is proposed, which integrates local jirga and human rights units into the existing formal justice (based on shari’a and positive law) and law-enforcement institutions. This experimental model provides a multi-dimensional framework that both reﬂects the cultural and religious values of Afghan society, and at the same time, has the capacity to draw on human rights principles. It is maintained that the model has the capacity to deliver justice expeditiously and in cost-effective ways; it also has a strong potential to act as a channel of communication between ordinary people and a modern participatory state in post-war Afghanistan. However, in order to test the applicability of this model in the real world, it needs ﬁrst to be thoroughly discussed among Afghan and international legal experts as well as among ordinary Afghan people, and then piloted in selected districts in Afghanistan.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,10,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Wardak","given":"Ali"}],"container-title":"Crime, Law and Social Change","DOI":"10.1023/B:CRIS.0000025765.73021.fa","ISSN":"0925-4994","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,5]]},"language":"en","page":"319-341","source":"Crossref","title":"Building a post-war justice system in Afghanistan","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1023/B:CRIS.0000025765.73021.fa","volume":"41"},

This complication and complicity is considered in the case of state organized race crime, and especially its “slow violence”, where victimization is attritional, dispersed, and hidden. Criminology is not merely compromised here—or limited in theoretical and empirical reach—but complicit, contributing to under-regulated racial violence rationalized in large part by the criminalization of race. The discipline might contribute to increased understanding of state organized race crime, and lessen its role therein, with greater commitments to critical race research and teaching.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Ward","given":"Geoff"}],"container-title":"Theoretical Criminology","container-title-short":"Theoretical Criminology","DOI":"10.1177/1362480614550119","ISSN":"1362-4806","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"299-314","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The slow violence of state organized race crime","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1362480614550119","volume":"19"},

Here we analyze a network epistemology model in which agents, all else being equal, prefer to take actions that conform with those of their neighbors. This preference for conformity interacts with the agents’ beliefs about which of two (or more) possible actions yields the better result. We find a range of possible outcomes, including stable polarization in belief and action. The model results are sensitive to network structure.

  {"id":"weaverFrontlashRaceDevelopment2007","abstract":"Civil rights cemented its place on the national agenda with the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, fair housing legislation, federal enforcement of school integration, and the outlawing of discriminatory voting mechanisms in the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Less recognized but no less important, the Second Reconstruction also witnessed one of the most punitive interventions in United States history. The death penalty was reinstated, felon disenfranchisement statutes from the First Reconstruction were revived, and the chain gang returned. State and federal governments revised their criminal codes, effectively abolishing parole, imposing mandatory minimum sentences, and allowing juveniles to be incarcerated in adult prisons. Meanwhile, the Law Enforcement Assistance Act of 1965 gave the federal government an altogether new role in crime control; several subsequent policies, beginning with the Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 and culminating with the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, ‘war on drugs,’ and extension of capital crimes, significantly altered the approach. These and other developments had an exceptional and long-lasting effect, with imprisonment increasing six-fold between 1973 and the turn of the century. Certain groups felt the burden of these changes most acutely. As of the last census, fully half of those imprisoned are black and one in three black men between ages 20 and 29 are currently under state supervision. Compared to its advanced industrial counterparts in western Europe, the United States imprisons at least five times more of its citizens per capita.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Weaver","given":"Vesla M."}],"container-title":"Studies in American Political Development","DOI":"10.1017/S0898588X07000211","ISSN":"1469-8692, 0898-588X","issue":"2","issued":{"literal":"2007/ed"},"language":"en","page":"230-265","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Frontlash: Race and the Development of Punitive Crime Policy","title-short":"Frontlash","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/studies-in-american-political-development/article/frontlash-race-and-the-development-of-punitive-crime-policy/9744286F944F1A250B94CD3AFB1A6021","volume":"21"},

Law and regulation are expected to enable innovation while protecting society from unintended consequences, such as risks to public health and the environment, privacy, data protection, and other fundamental rights and interests. However, law is often considered either as an obstacle to innovations or as unable to protect society from their risks. Moreover, the very notion of the Rule of Law as a principle governing legitimate exercise of power in democratic societies is undergoing change, and, in some extreme cases, might even be challenged where technological fixes are replacing traditional legal rules.  This collection of policy papers is based on the sixth annual conference hosted by the Amsterdam Centre for European Law and Governance at the University of Amsterdam on 4 November 2016. Against the backdrop of revolutionary technological developments in the digital world as well as the impacts of technological innovations on health, safety and the environment, the contributors  explore the relationship between law and technology with a particular focus on challenges and opportunities for EU law and regulation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Weimer","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Cseres","given":"Kati"},{"family":"Eckes","given":"Christina"},{"family":"Brownsword","given":"Roger"},{"family":"Calster","given":"Geert","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Garnett","given":"Kathleen"},{"family":"Reins","given":"Leonie"},{"family":"Ezrachi","given":"Ariel"},{"family":"Stucke","given":"Maurice E."},{"family":"Hervey","given":"Tamara K."},{"family":"Lynskey","given":"Orla"},{"family":"Spiecker","given":"Indra"}],"DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.3005914","event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,7,20]]},"language":"en","number":"ID 3005914","publisher":"Social Science Research Network","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"papers.ssrn.com","title":"The Rule of Law in the Technological Age Challenges and Opportunities for the EU Collected Papers","type":"report","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3005914"},

  {"id":"weissHowCanPolycentric2017","abstract":"Spectrum policy in the US (and throughout most of the world) consists generally of a set of nationally determined policies that apply uniformly to all localities. However, it is also true that there is considerable variation in the features (e.g., traffic demand or population density), requirements and constraints of spectrum use on a local basis. Global spectrum policies designed to resolve a situation in New York City could well be overly restrictive for communities in rural areas (such as central Wyoming). At the same time, it is necessary to ensure that more permissive policies of central Wyoming would not create problems for NYC (by ensuring, for example, that relocated radios adapt to local policies). Notions of polycentric governance that have been articulated by the late E. Ostrom [16] argue that greater good can be achieved by allowing for local autonomy in resource allocation. Shared access to spectrum is generally mediated through one of several technologies. As shown in [21], approaches mediated by geolocation databases are the most cost effective in today's technology. In the database oriented Spectrum Access System, or SAS, proposed by the FCC, users are granted (renewable) usage rights based on their location for a limited period of time. Because this system grants usage rights on a case-bycase basis, it may also allow for greater local autonomy while still maintaining global coordination. For example, it would be technically feasible for the database to include parameters such as transmit power, protocol, and bandwidth. Thus, they may provide the platform by which polycentric governance might come to spectrum management. In this paper, we explore, through some case examples, what polycentric governance of spectrum might look like and how this could be implemented in a database-driven spectrum management system. In many ways this paper is a complement to [20], which evaluted emerging SAS architectures using Ostrom's socioeconomic theory. This paper explores how a SAS-based system could be constructed that is consistent with Ostrom's polycentric governance ideas. Our approach is to address spectrum management as an emergent phenomenon rather than a top down system. This paper will describe the key details of this system and present some initial modeling results in comparison with the traditional global model of spectrum regulation. It will also discuss some of the concerns associated with this approach.","author":[{"family":"Weiss","given":"Martin B H"},{"family":"Krishnamurthy","given":"Prashant"},{"family":"Gomez","given":"Marcela M."}],"container-title":"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","DOI":"10.1109/DySPAN.2017.7920756","event":"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN)","ISSN":"null","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,3]]},"page":"1-10","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"How can polycentric governance of spectrum work?","type":"paper-conference"},

Using network modeling and data drawn from logs of social behavior inside the virtual world Second Life, we combine individual- and network-level theories into an integrated model of online social relationship formation. Results reveal that time spent online and the network pressure toward balance (individuals tending to form relationships with others who have relationships in common) predict the emergence of online relationship ties, while gender, age, proximity, homophily (the tendency of individuals to form relationships among people with similar traits), and preferential attachment are not significant predictors within the observed networks.

  {"id":"wendlingAltRight4chanWhite2018","abstract":"Aside from the election of Donald Trump, the most surprising political development of the past few years has been the rapid rise of the Alt-Right--the white nationalist, anti-feminist, far-right movement that provided much of the ground-level energy for Trump's campaign and has been a focus of international media attention ever since. Yet we still rarely get a clear sense of who and what the Alt-Right actually are, and what their long-term effect is likely to be. Journalist Mike Wendling knows. He's been following the Alt-Right closely for years, and with this book he shares the deep knowledge he's gleaned. Media accounts to the contrary, the Alt-Right didn't just burst out of nowhere in 2016--rather, they have been building their network quietly for years, using bulletin boards and social media to spread a toxic hybrid of technological utopianism, reactionary philosophy, and racial hatred. Wendling traces clearly the rise of the movement and the evolution of its ideas, and he introduces us to some of its key figures--many of whom he interviewed personally for the book. He explores links between Alt-Right rhetoric and hate crimes and terrorism, showing that the evidence connecting them is undeniable. Ultimately, however, he builds a strong case that the movement's lack of a coherent base and its contradictory tendencies are already sapping its strength and will lead to its downfall. A shocking exposé of a movement whose emergence stunned the world, Alt-Right presents a disturbing picture of our current political moment.","author":[{"family":"Wendling","given":"Mike"}],"ISBN":"978-0-7453-3745-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"294","publisher":"Pluto Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Alt-Right: From 4chan to the White House","title-short":"Alt-Right","type":"book"},

As social influence can be maximized for many purposes, such as marketing, politics, spreading innovations, there are many stakeholders interested in progress in this area. As it has been shown, for most settings finding an optimal seed set is an NP-hard problem, this is why various heuristics started to emerge since the statement of the problem. In this work, we explore the applicability of evolutionary algorithm for influence maximization. The experiments conducted using real and artificial social networks and the linear threshold influence model show that this approach offers not only speed and accuracy. Also, some other interesting features have been found, such as the transferability of its parameters to other datasets. Summarizing the results, it was observed that the evolutionary algorithm does not lose its performance when limiting its time by the factor of two and for most datasets, we obtained a high correlation of ranked parameters’ sets used for the evolutionary algorithm, typically around 0.9. Overall, these features combined make this approach an interesting research direction for influence maximization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Weskida","given":"Michał"},{"family":"Michalski","given":"Radosław"}],"container-title":"Journal of Computational Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.jocs.2018.12.010","ISSN":"18777503","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2]]},"language":"en","page":"77-85","source":"Crossref","title":"Finding influentials in social networks using evolutionary algorithm","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S187775031830070X","volume":"31"},

  {"id":"westenTwoRulesLegality2007","abstract":"Criminal law scholars approach legality in various ways. Some scholars eschew over-arching principles and proceed directly to one or more distinct “rules”: (1) the rule against retroactive criminalization; (2) the rule that criminal statutes be construed narrowly; (3) the rule against the judicial creation of common-law offenses; and (4) the rule that vague criminal statutes are void. Other scholars seek a single principle, i.e., the “principle of legality,” that they claim underlies the four rules. In contrast, I believe that both approaches are misguided. There is no such thing as a single “principle of legality;” yet, the four aforementioned rules are not unrelated to each other. The so-called “principle of legality” consists of two distinct norms that derive, respectively, from two fundamental principles of criminal justice, viz., the principle, “No person shall be punished in the absence of a bad mind,” and the principle that underlies the maxim, “Every person is presumed innocent until proven guilty.” The first norm of legality explains the rules regarding ex post facto legislation, and rules regarding “notice” and “fair warning” of judicial decisions. When a person is punished for violating a rule that was non-existent or unclear at the time he acted, he is punished for conduct that the state now condemns and seeks to prevent by means of penal sanctions. Accordingly, at the time the person is prosecuted, his claim is not that he did not do anything that the state regards as wrong, but, rather, that he neither knew nor should have known that he was doing something that the state would come to regard as wrong. He ought, indeed, to be excused for his mistake, but only because of a principle that is common to excuses generally: “No person ought to be punished in the absence of a guilty mind.” He should be excused because even when a person does something the state condemns and seeks to prevent, he ought not to be blamed for it unless he was motivated in a certain way, namely, by an attitude of disrespect for the legitimate interests of the political community by whose norms he is bound.The second norm of legality informs several of the remaining rules, though not all of them. The second norm is that a person ought not to be punished in the name of a political community unless it can confidently be said that the community officially regards his conduct as warranting the criminal punishment at issue. It is a norm that is most commonly associated with the rule of lenity, but it is not confined to the construction of statutes that are ambiguous or vague. It can also be also violated when a person is punished for violating a statute that has fallen into desuetude, regardless of how widely promulgated or narrowly defined the statute may be. This second norm derives from a principle that also underlies the presumption of innocence – the only difference being that the presumption of innocence is a preference for acquittal in the event of uncertainty regarding the facts which an actor is charged, while the second norm of legality is a preference for acquittal in the event of uncertainty regarding the scope of the offense which he is charged.Nevertheless, one “rule” remains that this analysis throws into question – namely, the rule that “vague” criminal statutes are void. Criminal statutes are sometimes so broadly defined that they do, indeed, infringe constitutionally protected rights of speech, movement, etc. – in which event they ought to be invalidated on those very grounds. And criminal statutes are sometimes so broadly drafted that, before applying them, courts ought to construe them to apply only to constitutionally unprotected acts that courts can confidently say the relevant political community regards as warranting punishment. But once statutes are so construed to apply only to constitutionally unprotected conduct, courts have no further reason to invalidate them on grounds of “vagueness.” Lack of “notice” is no reason to invalidate them because, with respect to the narrowly defined conduct such statutes are construed to prohibit, “common social duty” alone ought to alert actors that their conduct is suspect.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Westen","given":"Peter"}],"container-title":"Law and Philosophy","container-title-short":"Law Philos","DOI":"10.1007/s10982-006-0007-7","ISSN":"1573-0522","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"229-305","source":"Springer Link","title":"Two Rules of Legality in Criminal Law","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10982-006-0007-7","volume":"26"},

  {"id":"westphalOvercomingInstitutionalDeficit2018","abstract":"Agonistic democrats have enriched debates on the political challenge of pluralism by raising awareness for the depth of disagreements and the political potentials of conflict. However, they have so far failed to explore the shape of institutional settings that are conducive to agonism and show how the agonistic stance may, in a very practical sense, strengthen democracies’ capacity to deal with pluralism and conflict. This article argues that this ‘institutional deficit’ of agonistic democracy can be overcome. It develops an approach that reads theories of agonistic democracy as accounts of conflict regulation and uses principles of agonistic politics as measures for a critical assessment of institutional design. A discussion of a test case that is prominent in the recent literature on democratic innovations for pluralist societies—mini-publics—demonstrates that the principles of agonistic conflict regulation as developed by Mouffe, Connolly and Tully provide the basis for both a critique of certain institutions and a development of alternative designs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Westphal","given":"Manon"}],"container-title":"Res Publica","container-title-short":"Res Publica","DOI":"10.1007/s11158-018-9397-2","ISSN":"1356-4765, 1572-8692","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,21]]},"language":"en","page":"1-24","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Overcoming the Institutional Deficit of Agonistic Democracy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11158-018-9397-2"},

  {"id":"whitakerParentingPowerlessConsequences2016","abstract":"Historically, African American parents have struggled to negotiate the tensions related to raising their children in a hostile society. The recent and tragic events involving the murders of unarmed African American boys and men by police officers, enraged motorists, and vigilante neighbors have sparked a resurgence in discussion and activism related to these historic tensions. In addition to protests and a heightened level of public discourse, there is also new emphasis on African American parents having “the Talk” with their children, particularly their sons. “The Talk” represents the “surviving interactions with police or other members of authority” discussion and is largely considered an essential rite of passage in African American homes. And, although the pretext for “the Talk” is providing children with the rule book for survival from an authoritative source, the subtext for this conversation is the inherent powerlessness of African American parents and their inability to protect their children. Despite its necessity, “the Talk” has an ugly underside that also manifests in disruptions to child development, families, and the larger community. These disruptions are particularly critical in an allegedly postracial environment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Whitaker","given":"Tracy R."},{"family":"Snell","given":"Cudore L."}],"container-title":"Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment","DOI":"10.1080/10911359.2015.1127736","ISSN":"1091-1359, 1540-3556","issue":"3-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,5,18]]},"language":"en","page":"303-309","source":"Crossref","title":"Parenting while powerless: Consequences of “the talk”","title-short":"Parenting while powerless","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10911359.2015.1127736","volume":"26"},

In order to protect people's privacy and prevent discrimination, these decision-makers may choose to delete or avoid collecting social category data, like sex and race. In this article, we argue that such censoring can exacerbate discrimination by making biases more difficult to detect. We begin by detailing how computerized decisions can lead to biases in the absence of social category data and in some contexts, may even sustain biases that arise by random chance. We then show how proactively using social category data can help illuminate and combat discriminatory practices, using cases from education and employment that lead to strategies for detecting and preventing discrimination. We conclude that discrimination can occur in any sociotechnical system in which someone decides to use an algorithmic process to inform decision-making, and we offer a set of broader implications for researchers and policymakers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,26]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Williams","given":"Betsy Anne"},{"family":"Brooks","given":"Catherine F."},{"family":"Shmargad","given":"Yotam"}],"container-title":"Journal of Information Policy","DOI":"10.5325/jinfopoli.8.2018.0078","ISSN":"2381-5892","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"page":"78-115","source":"JSTOR","title":"How Algorithms Discriminate Based on Data They Lack: Challenges, Solutions, and Policy Implications","title-short":"How Algorithms Discriminate Based on Data They Lack","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/jinfopoli.8.2018.0078","volume":"8"},

Digital platforms are heterogeneous, so no flavour of ‘platform regulation’ is likely to be appropriate across all platforms, whilst horizontal laws apply to platform and other business models alike. However, a unifying theme in relation to platforms is that they provide market governance via codes of conduct and software code. Rather than thinking of law as something that should simply be imposed on the market, we should therefore search for an accommodation or balance between law and 'code', given that they both provide governance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Williamson","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Bunting","given":"Mark"}],"container-title":"SSRN Electronic Journal","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.3188937","ISSN":"1556-5068","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","source":"Crossref","title":"Reconciling Private Market Governance and Law: A Policy Primer for Digital Platforms","title-short":"Reconciling Private Market Governance and Law","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=3188937"},

  {"id":"wilsonEthicalPoliticalAgency2019","abstract":"Social and socioeconomic interactions and transactions often require trust. In digital spaces, the main approach to facilitating trust has effectively been to try to reduce or even remove the need for it through the implementation of reputation systems. These generate metrics based on digital data such as ratings and reviews submitted by users, interaction histories, and so on, that are intended to label individuals as more or less reliable or trustworthy in a particular interaction context. We undertake a disclosive archaeology (Introna, 2014) of typical reputation systems, identifying relevant figuration agencies including affordances and prohibitions, (cyborg) identities, (cyborg) practices and discourses, in order to examine their ethico-political agency. We suggest that conventional approaches to the design of such systems are rooted in a capitalist, competitive paradigm, relying on methodological individualism, and that the reputation technologies themselves thus embody and enact this paradigm within whatever space they operate. We question whether the politics, ethics and philosophy that contribute to this paradigm align with those of some of the contexts in which reputation systems are now being used, and suggest that alternative approaches to the establishment of trust and reputation in digital spaces need to be considered for alternative contexts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Wilson","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Paoli","given":"Stefano De"}],"container-title":"First Monday","DOI":"10.5210/fm.v24i2.9393","ISSN":"13960466","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,1]]},"language":"en","source":"journals.uic.edu","title":"On the ethical and political agency of online reputation systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/9393","volume":"24"},

In the present study, we examined the potential effects of professor age and gender on student perceptions of the teacher as well as their anticipated rapport in the classroom. We also asked students to rate each instructor's attractiveness based on societal beliefs about age and beauty. We expected students to rate a picture of a middle-aged female professor more negatively (and less attractive) than the younger version of the same woman. For the young versus old man offered in a photograph, we expected no age effects.

However, the regulatory responses to the crisis of social media are still mostly considered unsatisfactory, as demonstrated by the widespread criticism of the German Network Enforcement Act of 2017. This article compares the current constitutional discourse on social media regulation with the debates that accompanied the last major transformation of the media landscape: the rise of broadcasting. While we certainly do not find a roadmap for social media regulation in the past, the key concept of the broadcasting discourse—the idea of media as a sphere of ‘institutional freedom’—can be applied to the challenges of today and can be used to strengthen the democratic function of social media.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Wischmeyer","given":"Thomas"}],"container-title":"European Law Journal","DOI":"10.1111/eulj.12312","ISSN":"1468-0386","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"169-181","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Making social media an instrument of democracy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/eulj.12312","volume":"25"},

Digital technologies have moved into every corner of life and the classic separation between work and non-work has become obsolete. The digital economy has become indistinguishable from life in the digital age. This is a book about the merger of economy and life, about life in digital capitalism. It explores four moments of digital transitions: The first chapter explores transitions of sharing, both as a concept or an ideology and as a social practice. The second chapter explores a transition in the political economy of media and communication and its recent turn to the work of Marx. The third chapter focuses on the building of the digital commons and its very particular economy of contribution. The final chapter turns the light on academic cultures and inspects the activist turn in academia.","author":[{"family":"Wittel","given":"Andreas"}],"event-place":"Saarbrücken","ISBN":"978-3-659-77964-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"ger","note":"OCLC: 1001458251","number-of-pages":"97","publisher":"LAP Lambert Academic Publishing","publisher-place":"Saarbrücken","source":"Gemeinsamer Bibliotheksverbund ISBN","title":"Digital transitions","type":"book"},
  {"id":"wittenbergMinimalPersuasiveAdvantage2020","abstract":"Concerns about video-based political misinformation, and particularly “deepfake” technology, are widespread in both popular and academic circles. These fears are predicated on the assumption that video is more persuasive than text. To date, however, this assumption remains largely untested in the context of political information. Here we provide such a test. We begin by drawing a theoretical distinction between two dimensions of belief for which there could be effects of video versus text: (i) one’s belief that a presented event actually occurred, versus (ii) the extent to which one’s attitudes are changed. To assess these two possibilities, we ran a high-powered survey experiment (20,428 observations from n = 4808 Americans, quota-matched to the general population on age, gender, ethnicity, and geographic region). Participants were presented with a selection of both political and non-political stories; for each story, they were randomly assigned to view either a short video or an annotated transcript of the video. While we find that video significantly increases belief that the presented events occurred, the effect is very small (Cohen’s d = 0.11). Moreover, we find that video has a small positive effect on the persuasiveness of, and engagement with, non-political content — but not political content. These results suggest that fears about the unique persuasive power of video-based political misinformation may be premature. Though video-based misinformation may seem (slightly) more believable than text-based misinformation, this enhanced credibility does not necessarily facilitate persuasion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Wittenberg","given":"Chloe"},{"family":"Berinsky","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Zong","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Rand","given":"David"}],"DOI":"10.31234/osf.io/r5yun","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,19]]},"publisher":"PsyArXiv","source":"psyarxiv.com","title":"The (Minimal) Persuasive Advantage of Political Video over Text","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://psyarxiv.com/r5yun/"},

  {"id":"wollebaekAngerFearEcho2019","abstract":"Emotions, such as anger and fear, have been shown to influence people’s political behavior. However, few studies link emotions specifically to how people debate political issues and seek political information online. In this article, we examine how anger and fear are related to politics-oriented digital behavior, attempting to bridge the gap between the thus far disconnected literature on political psychology and the digital media. Based on survey data, we show that anger and fear are connected to distinct behaviors online. Angry people are more likely to engage in debates with people having both similar and opposing views. They also seek out information confirming their views more frequently. Anxious individuals, by contrast, tend to seek out information contradicting their opinions. These findings reiterate predictions made in the extant literature concerning the role of emotions in politics. Thus, we argue that anger reinforces echo chamber dynamics and trench warfare dynamics in the digital public sphere, while fear counteracts these dynamics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Wollebæk","given":"Dag"},{"family":"Karlsen","given":"Rune"},{"family":"Steen-Johnsen","given":"Kari"},{"family":"Enjolras","given":"Bernard"}],"container-title":"Social Media + Society","container-title-short":"Social Media + Society","DOI":"10.1177/2056305119829859","ISSN":"2056-3051","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Anger, Fear, and Echo Chambers: The Emotional Basis for Online Behavior","title-short":"Anger, Fear, and Echo Chambers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/2056305119829859","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"woodFoolMeOnce2018","abstract":"A lack of transparency for online political advertising has long been a problem in American political campaigns. Disinformation attacks that American voters have experienced since the 2016 campaign have made the need for regulatory action more pressing.\n\nInternet platforms prefer self-regulation and have only recently come around to supporting proposed transparency legislation. While government must not regulate the content of political speech, it can, and should, force transparency into the process. We propose several interventions aimed at transparency. First, and most importantly, campaign finance regulators should require platforms to store and make available (1) ads run on their platforms, and (2) the audience at whom the ad was targeted. Audience availability can be structured to avoid privacy concerns, and it meets an important speech value in the “marketplace of ideas” theory of the First Amendment—that of enabling counter speech. Our proposed regulations would capture any political advertising, including disinformation, that is promoted via paid distribution on social media, as well as all other online political advertising. Second, existing loopholes in transparency regulations related to online advertising should be closed. Congress has a role here as it has prevented regulatory agencies from acting to require disclosure from so-called dark money groups. Finally, government should require that platforms offer an opt-in system for social media users to view narrowly-targeted ads or disputed content.","author":[{"family":"Wood","given":"Abby K."},{"family":"Ravel","given":"Ann M."}],"container-title":"Southern California Law Review","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,18]]},"source":"Google Scholar","title":"Fool Me Once: Regulating Fake News and Other Online Advertising","title-short":"Fool Me Once","type":"article-journal","volume":"91"},

  {"id":"woolleyComputationalPropagandaPolitical2018","abstract":"Social media platforms do not just circulate political ideas, they support manipulative disinformation campaigns. While some of these disinformation campaigns are carried out directly by individuals, most are waged by software, commonly known as bots, programmed to perform simple, repetitive, robotic tasks. Some social media bots collect and distribute legitimate information, while others communicate with and harass people, manipulate trending algorithms, and inundate systems with spam. Campaigns made up of bots, fake accounts, and trolls can be coordinated by one person, or a small group of people, to give the illusion of large-scale consensus. Some political regimes use political bots to silence opponents and to push official state messaging, to sway the vote during elections, and to defame critics, human rights defenders, civil society groups, and journalists. This book argues that such automation and platform manipulation, amounts to a new political communications mechanism that Samuel Woolley and Philip N. Noward call \"computational propaganda.\" This differs from older styles of propaganda in that it uses algorithms, automation, and human curation to purposefully distribute misleading information over social media networks while it actively learns from and mimicks real people so as to manipulate public opinion across a diverse range of platforms and device networks. This book includes cases of computational propaganda from nine countries (both democratic and authoritarian) and four continents (North and South America, Europe, and Asia), covering propaganda efforts over a wide array of social media platforms and usage in different types of political processes (elections, referenda, and during political crises).","author":[{"family":"Woolley","given":"Samuel C."},{"family":"Howard","given":"Philip N."}],"ISBN":"978-0-19-093140-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,12]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"273","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Computational Propaganda: Political Parties, Politicians, and Political Manipulation on Social Media","title-short":"Computational Propaganda","type":"book"},

  {"id":"wuMisinformationDetectionSocial2019","abstract":"The pervasive use of social media gives it a crucial role in helping the public perceive reliable information. Meanwhile, the openness and timeliness of social networking sites also allow for the rapid creation and dissemination of misinformation. It becomes increasingly difficult for online users to find accurate and trustworthy information. As witnessed in recent incidents of misinformation, it escalates quickly and can impact social media users with undesirable consequences and wreak havoc instantaneously. Different from some existing research in psychology and social sciences about misinformation, social media platforms pose unprecedented challenges for misinformation detection. First, intentional spreaders of misinformation will actively disguise themselves. Second, content of misinformation may be manipulated to avoid being detected, while abundant contextual information may play a vital role in detecting it. Third, not only accuracy, earliness of a detection method is also important in containing misinformation from being viral. Fourth, social media platforms have been used as a fundamental data source for various disciplines, and these research may have been conducted in the presence of misinformation. To tackle the challenges, we focus on developing machine learning algorithms that are robust to adversarial manipulation and data scarcity.\n\nThe main objective of this dissertation is to provide a systematic study of misinformation detection in social media. To tackle the challenges of adversarial attacks, I propose adaptive detection algorithms to deal with the active manipulations of misinformation spreaders via content and networks. To facilitate content-based approaches, I analyze the contextual data of misinformation and propose to incorporate the specific contextual patterns of misinformation into a principled detection framework. Considering its rapidly growing nature, I study how misinformation can be detected at an early stage. In particular, I focus on the challenge of data scarcity and propose a novel framework to enable historical data to be utilized for emerging incidents that are seemingly irrelevant. With misinformation being viral, applications that rely on social media data face the challenge of corrupted data. To this end, I present robust statistical relational learning and personalization algorithms to minimize the negative effect of misinformation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Wu","given":"Liang"}],"call-number":"2226166508","event-place":"Arizona, United States","genre":"PhD Diss.","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,3]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"136","publisher":"Arizona State University","publisher-place":"Arizona, United States","source":"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global","title":"Misinformation Detection in Social Media - ProQuest","type":"thesis","URL":"https://search.proquest.com/openview/0ebfedca12e3b73d4311d1f01acaf87f/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y"},
  {"id":"wurmanConstitutionalAdministration2017","abstract":"Abstract. Administrative law rests on two fictions. The first, the nondelegation doctrine, imagines that Congress does not delegate legislative power to agencies. The second, which flows from the first, is that the administrative state thus exercises only executive power, even if that power sometimes looks legislative or judicial. These fictions are required by a formalist reading of the Constitution, whose Vesting Clauses permit only Congress to make law and the President only to execute the law. This formalist reading requires us to accept as a matter of practice unconstitutional delegation and the resulting violation of the separation of powers, while pretending as a matter of doctrine that no violation occurs.\nThis Article argues that we ought to accept the delegation of legislative power as a matter of doctrine because doing so can help remedy the undermining of the separation of powers. Accepting delegation as a matter of doctrine allows us to delineate the legislative, executive, and judicial components of administration and to empower each constitutional branch of government over the component corresponding to its own constitutional function. With this insight, for example, a legislative veto of the administration’s legislative acts is constitutional.\nThis Article seeks to make one functionalist move (accepting delegation) in order to deploy formalist tools to restore some semblance of the original constitutional scheme of separate powers. It seeks to take both formalism, which has served merely to mask the administrative state’s unconstitutional foundations, and functionalism, which has failed to offer any limiting principles to modern administrative practices, more seriously than modern scholars and doctrine do. A functionalist approach to delegation allows us to deploy formalism—but an honest formalism—to the separation of powers.","author":[{"family":"Wurman","given":"Ilan"}],"container-title":"Stanford Law Review","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"page":"359-434","title":"Constitutional Administration","type":"article-journal","volume":"69"},

We offer a thorough analysis of a highly successful disinformation account run by Russia’s Internet Research Agency: the so-called ‘Jenna Abrams’ account. We analyze Abrams’ tweets and other content such as blogposts with qualitative discourse analysis, assisted by quantitative content analysis and metadata analysis. This yields an in-depth understanding of how the IRA team behind the Abrams account presented this persona across multiple platforms and over time. Especially, we describe the techniques used to perform personal authenticity and cultural competence. The performance of personal authenticity was central to her persona building as a likeable American woman, whereas the performance of cultural competence enabled her to infiltrate American conservative communities with resonant messages.

Algorithmic regulation refers to decisionmaking systems that regulate a domain of activity in order to manage risk or alter behavior through continual computational generation of knowledge by systematically collecting data (in real time on a continuous basis) emitted directly from numerous dynamic components pertaining to the regulated environment in order to identify and, if necessary, automatically refine (or prompt refinement of) the system's operations to attain a pre-specified goal. This study provides a descriptive analysis of algorithmic regulation, classifying these decisionmaking systems as either reactive or pre-emptive, and offers a taxonomy that identifies eight different forms of algorithmic regulation based on their configuration at each of the three stages of the cybernetic process: notably, at the level of standard setting (adaptive vs. fixed behavioral standards), information-gathering and monitoring (historic data vs. predictions based on inferred data), and at the level of sanction and behavioral change (automatic execution vs. recommender systems). It maps the contours of several emerging debates surrounding algorithmic regulation, drawing upon insights from regulatory governance studies, legal critiques, surveillance studies, and critical data studies to highlight various concerns about the legitimacy of algorithmic regulation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Yeung","given":"Karen"}],"container-title":"Regulation & Governance","DOI":"10.1111/rego.12158","ISSN":"1748-5991","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,12]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/rego.12158","page":"505-523","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Algorithmic regulation: A critical interrogation","title-short":"Algorithmic regulation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/rego.12158","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"yeungUrbanImageryMain1996","abstract":"This paper applies Kevin Lynch's famous thesis of legibility to the main street of Singapore?Orchard Road. It is primarily concerned with three issues. How legible is Orchard Road in the eyes of Singaporeans? Who find Orchard Road legible? If Orchard Road is legible to Singaporeans, why is it so? Based upon a combination of comprehensive questionnaire survey of Singaporeans and personal interviews with residents and businessmen operating in Orchard Road, this paper argues that the landscape of Orchard Road, known as the Orchardscape in this paper, is very legible to most Singaporeans. Its legibility is particularly prominent among those with higher education and higher income levels. There is also a distance-decay effect in the Singaporean cognition of the Orchardscape. The legibility of the Orchardscape is explained in relation to the personal and cultural background of individual Singaporeans and landscape cues. We argue that both sets of factors must be taken into consideration in understanding the image of the city. Some practical implications for future city design and planning are offered in the concluding section of the paper.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Yeung","given":"Henry Wai-chung"},{"family":"Savage","given":"Victor R."}],"container-title":"Urban Studies","container-title-short":"Urban Studies","DOI":"10.1080/00420989650011870","ISSN":"0042-0980","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[1996,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"473-494","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Urban Imagery and the Main Street of the Nation: The Legibility of Orchard Road in the Eyes of Singaporeans","title-short":"Urban Imagery and the Main Street of the Nation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00420989650011870","volume":"33"},

  {"id":"youngStudentEvaluationsTeaching2019","abstract":"In the last 10–15 years, many institutions of higher education have switched from paper-and-pencil methods to online methods of administering student evaluations of teaching (SETs). One consequence has been a significant reduction in the response rates to such instruments. The current study was conducted to identify whether offering in-class time to students to complete online SETs would increase response rates. A quasi-experiment (nonequivalent group design) was conducted in which one group of tenured faculty instructed students to bring electronic devices with internet capabilities on a specified day and offered in-class time to students to complete online SETs. A communication protocol for faculty members’ use was developed and implemented. A comparison group of tenured faculty who did not offer in-class time for SET completion was identified and the difference-in-differences method was used to compare the previous year’s response rates for the same instructor teaching the same course across the two groups. Response rates were substantially higher when faculty provided in-class time to students to complete SETs. These results indicate that high response rates can be obtained for online SETs submitted by students in face-to-face classes if faculty communicate the importance of SETs in both their words and actions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Young","given":"Karen"},{"family":"Joines","given":"Jeffrey"},{"family":"Standish","given":"Trey"},{"family":"Gallagher","given":"Victoria"}],"container-title":"Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education","DOI":"10.1080/02602938.2018.1467878","ISSN":"0260-2938","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,2]]},"page":"37-49","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Student evaluations of teaching: the impact of faculty procedures on response rates","title-short":"Student evaluations of teaching","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/02602938.2018.1467878","volume":"44"},

The most significant findings of the study are the following: There is a moderate correlation between low grades and low evaluations, but no correlation between high grades and high evaluations when all cases are considered together. Analysis and interpretation of the data suggests that SETs should not be used to compare language instructors.

The analytical framework will reduce the discussion to two dimensions, every one of which addressing two central elements. These four factors call for a distinct discussion, which is at times absent in the existing literature. The two dimensions are (1) the specific and novel problems the process assumedly generates and (2) the specific attributes which exacerbate them. While the problems are articulated in a variety of ways, they most likely could be reduced to two broad categories: efficiency and fairness-based concerns.

  {"id":"zatzGetWorkGo2019","abstract":"Work requirements backed by threats of incarceration offer a fertile but neglected site for sociolegal inquiry. These “carceral work mandates” confound familiar accounts of both the neoliberal state’s production of precarious work through deregulation and the penal state’s production of racialized exclusion from labor markets. In two illustrative contexts—child support enforcement and criminal legal debt—demands for work emerge as efforts to increase and then seize earnings from indigent debtors; an ability to pay is defined to include an ability to work. In a third, demands for work are imposed directly through probation, parole, and other community supervision. In each context, the carceral state regulates work outside of prison. It defines appropriate labor conditions through concepts of voluntary unemployment, and it enables employers to discipline or retaliate against workers by triggering state violence. Additionally, mandated work may be removed from employment law protections when the carceral context dominates its sociolegal meaning. Finally, the resulting vulnerable workforces can be used to displace or discipline other workers not personally subject to carceral work mandates. Analogies to welfare work requirements, workplace immigration enforcement, and prison labor illustrate these points. Implications are considered for theorizing contemporary racial political economy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Zatz","given":"Noah D."}],"container-title":"Law & Social Inquiry","DOI":"10.1017/lsi.2019.56","ISSN":"0897-6546, 1747-4469","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"1-35","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"Get to Work or Go to Jail: State Violence and the Racialized Production of Precarious Work","title-short":"Get to Work or Go to Jail","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/law-and-social-inquiry/article/get-to-work-or-go-to-jail-state-violence-and-the-racialized-production-of-precarious-work/75240FEFBE2355E8CD24595F84633CDF"},

  {"id":"zhangConsumptionPerformanceUnderstanding2020","abstract":"We develop a general agent-based modeling and computational simulation approach to study the impact of various factors on the temporal dynamics of recommender systems’ performance. The proposed agent-based simulation approach allows for comprehensive analysis of longitudinal recommender systems performance under a variety of diverse conditions, which typically is not feasible with live real-world systems. We specifically focus on exploring the product consumption strategies and show that, over time, user–recommender interactions consistently lead to the longitudinal performance paradox of recommender systems. In particular, users’ reliance on the system’s recommendations to make item choices generally tends to make the recommender system less useful in the long run or, more specifically, negatively impacts the longitudinal dynamics of several important dimensions of recommendation performance. Furthermore, we explore the nuances of the performance paradox via additional explorations of longitudinal dynamics of recommender systems for a variety of user populations and consumption strategies, as well as personalized and nonpersonalized recommendation approaches. One interesting discovery from our exploration is that a certain hybrid consumption strategy—that is, where users rely on a combination of both personalized- and popularity-based recommendations, offers a unique ability to substantially improve consumption relevance over time. In other words, for such hybrid consumption settings, recommendation algorithms facilitate the general “quality-rises-to-the-top” phenomenon, which is not present in the pure popularity-based consumption. In addition to discussing a number of interesting performance patterns, the paper also analyzes and provides insights into the underlying factors that drive such patterns.

  {"id":"zhangDirectVsIndirect2018","abstract":"With the availability of large-scale network data, peer influence in social networks can be more rigorously examined and understood than before. Peer influence can arise from immediate neighbors in the network (formally defined as cohesion or direct ties with one-hop neighbors) and from indirect peers who share common neighbors (formally defined as structural equivalence or indirect ties with two-hop neighbors). While the literature examined the role of each peer influence (direct or indirect) separately, the study of both peer network effects acting simultaneously was ignored, largely because of methodological constraints. This paper attempts to fill this gap by evaluating the simultaneous effect of both direct and indirect peer influences in technology adoption in the context of caller ringback tone (CRBT) in a cellular telephone network, using data from 200 million calls by 1.4 million users. Given that such a large-scale network makes traditional social network analysis intractable, we extract many densely connected and self-contained subpopulations from the network. We find a regularity in these subpopulations in that they consist either of about 200 nodes or about 500 nodes. Using these subpopulations and panel data, we analyze direct and indirect peer influences using a novel autoprobit model with multiple network terms (direct and indirect peer influence, with homophily as a control variable). Our identification strategy relies on a newly designed spatial autoregressive model, allowing us to identify the direct and indirect peer influences on each of the extracted subpopulations. We use meta-analysis to summarize the estimated parameters from all subpopulations. The results show CRBT adoption to be simultaneously determined by both direct and indirect peer influence (while controlling for homophily and centrality). Robustness checks show model fit to improve when both peer influences are included. The size and direction of the two peer influences, however, differ by group size. Interestingly, indirect peer influence (structural equivalence) plays a negative role in diffusion when group size is about 200, but a positive role when group size is about 500. The role of direct peer influence (cohesion), on the other hand, is always positive, irrespective of group size. Our findings imply that businesses must design different target strategies for large versus small groups: for large groups, businesses should focus on consumers with both multiple one-hop and two-hop neighbors; for small groups, businesses should only focus on consumers with multiple one-hop neighbors.The online appendix is available at https://doi-org.proxy.lib.uiowa.edu/10.1287/isre.2017.0753.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Bin"},{"family":"Pavlou","given":"Paul A."},{"family":"Krishnan","given":"Ramayya"}],"container-title":"Information Systems Research","container-title-short":"Information Systems Research","DOI":"10.1287/isre.2017.0753","ISSN":"1047-7047","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,2]]},"page":"292-314","publisher":"INFORMS","source":"pubsonline-informs-org.proxy.lib.uiowa.edu (Atypon)","title":"On Direct vs. Indirect Peer Influence in Large Social Networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2017.0753","volume":"29"},

To date, there has been little data-driven analysis of the effects of regulated content deemed inappropriate on online user behavior. We therefore compared Twitter — a popular social media platform that occasionally removes content in violation of its Terms of Service — to Gab — a platform that markets itself as completely unregulated. Launched in mid-2016, Gab is, in practice, dominated by individuals who associate with the “alt-right” political movement in the United States. Despite its billing as “The Free Speech Social Network,” Gab users display more extreme social hierarchy and elitism when compared to Twitter. Although the framing of the site welcomes all people, Gab users’ content is more homogeneous, preferentially sharing material from sites traditionally associated with the extremes of American political discourse, especially the far right. Furthermore, many of these sites are associated with state-sponsored propaganda from foreign governments. Finally, we discovered a significant presence of German language posts on Gab, with several topics focusing on German domestic politics, yet sharing significant amounts of content from U.S. and Russian sources. These results indicate possible emergent linkages between domestic politics in European and American far right political movements.

As an interdisciplinary topic, the study of fake news encourages a concerted effort of experts in computer and information science, political science, journalism, social science, psychology, and economics. A comprehensive framework to systematically understand and detect fake news is necessary to attract and unite researchers in related areas to conduct research on fake news. This tutorial aims to clearly present (1) fake news research, its challenges, and research directions; (2) a comparison between fake news and other related concepts (e.g., rumors); (3) the fundamental theories developed across various disciplines that facilitate interdisciplinary research; (4) various detection strategies unified under a comprehensive framework for fake news detection; and (5) the state-of-the-art datasets, patterns, and models. We present fake news detection from various perspectives, which involve news content and information in social networks, and broadly adopt techniques in data mining, machine learning, natural language processing, information retrieval and social search.

This article shows that as party elites have become more polarized, individuals have become better able to identify the party that best matches their own ideological positions, thereby contributing to polarization at the mass level. Using forty years of ANES and DW-NOMINATE data to test this argument, it was found that the relationship between a voter’s position in policy space and their political behavior is indeed conditional upon polarization at the elite level.

Our study exploits four distinct natural experiments that arose when the SET instrument was changed. To maximise power, we compare the same course/instructor before and after each of the four changes occurred. We find that switching from in-class, paper course evaluations to online evaluations generates an average change of −0.14 points on a five-point scale, or 0.25 standard deviations (SDs) in the overall instructor ratings. Changing labelling of the scale and the wording of the overall instructor question generates another decrease in the average rating: −0.15 of a point (0.27 SDs). In contrast, extending the evaluation period to include the final examination and offering an incentive (early grade release) for completing the evaluations do not have a statistically significant effect on the overall instructor rating. The cumulative impact of these individual changes is −0.29 points (0.52 SDs). This large decrease shows that SET scores are not comparable over time when instruments change.

It also contends that three desiderata for the institutionalization of the function of constitutional review follow from this conception: structural independence, democratic sensitivity and the maintenance of legal integrity. Finally, evaluating three broadly different ways of institutionalizing constitutional review - solely in appellate courts, in deliberative constitutional juries of ordinary citizens and in a combined system of constitutional courts and civic constitutional amendment fora - it argues that the third arrangement would perform best at collectively fulfilling the sometimes antithetical desiderata.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Zurn","given":"Christopher F."}],"container-title":"Theoria: A Journal of Social and Political Theory","ISSN":"0040-5817","issue":"127","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"page":"63-94","source":"JSTOR","title":"Judicial Review, Constitutional Juries and Civic Constitutional Fora: Rights, Democracy and Law","title-short":"Judicial Review, Constitutional Juries and Civic Constitutional Fora","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/41802505","volume":"58"},

This paper first critically investigates prominent conceptual and practical bootstrapping objections advanced by Barnett and Michelman. It then argues that the real conceptual root of such bootstrapping objections is not any specific substantive account of legitimacy makers, such as consent or democratic endorsement, but a particular conception of the logic of normative standards—the determinate threshold conception—that the critic attributes to the putatively undermined account of legitimacy. The paper further claims that when we abandon threshold conceptions of the logic of legitimacy in favor of regulative-ideal conceptions, then the objections, from bootstrapping paradoxes to the very idea of constitutional democracy, disappear. It concludes with considerations in favor of adopting a more demanding conception of the regulative ideal of constitutional democracy, advanced by Habermas, focusing on potentials for developmental learning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Zurn","given":"Christopher F."}],"container-title":"Legal Theory","DOI":"10.1017/S1352325210000169","ISSN":"1469-8048, 1352-3252","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,9]]},"language":"en","page":"191-227","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"THE LOGIC OF LEGITIMACY: Bootstrapping Paradoxes of Constitutional Democracy*","title-short":"THE LOGIC OF LEGITIMACY","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/legal-theory/article/logic-of-legitimacy-bootstrapping-paradoxes-of-constitutional-democracy/B4AAD69520CEEB436142FCC61A261695","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"zywickiRuleLawFreedom2003","abstract":"After decades of neglect, interest in the nature and consequences of the rule of law has revived in recent years. In the United States, the Supreme Court's decision in Bush v. Gore has triggered renewed interest in the nature of the rule of law in the Anglo-American tradition. Meanwhile, economists have increasingly come to realize the importance of political and legal institutions, especially the presence of the rule of law, in providing the foundation of freedom and prosperity in developing countries. The emerging economies of Eastern Europe and the developing world in Latin America and Africa have thus sought guidance on how to grow the rule of law in these parts of the world that traditionally have lacked its blessings. This essay summarizes the philosophical and historical foundations of the rule of law, why Bush v. Gore can be understood as a validation of the rule of law, and explores the consequences of the presence or absence of the rule of law in developing countries.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,13]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Zywicki","given":"Todd J."}],"container-title":"Supreme Court Economic Review","ISSN":"0736-9921","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003]]},"page":"1-26","publisher":"[University of Chicago, University of Chicago Press]","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Rule of Law, Freedom, and Prosperity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1147136","volume":"10"}
